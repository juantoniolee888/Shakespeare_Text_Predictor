In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wea- -ries me you say it wea- -ries you
What stuff 'tis made of where- -of it is born
That curt- -sy to them do them rev- -er- -ence
As they fly by them with their wo- -ven wings
Be- -lieve me sir had I such ven- -ture forth
The bet- -ter part of my af- -fec- -tions would
Pluck- -ing the grass to know where sits the wind
Peer- -ing in maps for ports and piers and roads
And ev- -ery ob- -ject that might make me fear
Mis- -for- -tune to my ven- -tures out of doubt
What harm a wind too great might do at sea
I should not see the sandy hour- -- -glass run
But I should think of shal- -lows and of flats
And see my wealthy An- -drew dock- -'d in sand
Vail- -ing her high top low- -er than her ribs
To kiss her buri- -al Should I go to church
Which touch- -ing but my gen- -tle ves- -sel's side
En- -robe the roar- -ing wa- -ters with my silks
And now worth noth- -ing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this and shall I lack the thought
Is sad to think up- -on his mer- -chan- -dise
Nor to one place nor is my whole es- -tate
There- -fore my mer- -chan- -dise makes me not sad
Na- -ture hath fram'd strange fel- -lows in her time
Some that will ev- -er- -more peep through their eyes
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
Here comes Bas- -sanio your most no- -ble kins- -man
We leave you now with bet- -ter com- -pa- -ny
I take it your own busi- -ness calls on you
You grow ex- -ceed- -ing strange must it be so?
I pray you have in mind where we must meet
You have too much re- -spect up- -on the world
They lose it that do buy it with much care
Be- -lieve me you are mar- -vel- -lous- -ly chang'd
I hold the world but as the world Gra- -tiano
A stage where ev- -ery man must play a part
With mirth and laugh- -ter let old wrin- -kles come
Than my heart cool with mor- -ti- -fy- -ing groans
Why should a man whose blood is warm with- -in
Do cream and man- -tle like a stand- -ing pond
And do a wil- -ful still- -ness en- -ter- -tain
With pur- -pose to be dress'd in an opin- -ion
Of wis- -dom grav- -i- -ty pro- -found con- -ceit
As who should say 'I am Sir Or- -a- -cle
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'
O my An- -to- -nio I do know of these
That there- -fore on- -ly are re- -put- -ed wise
For say- -ing noth- -ing when I am very sure
If they should speak would al- -most damn those ears
Which hear- -ing them would call their broth- -ers fools
I'll tell thee more of this an- -oth- -er time
I must be one of these same dumb wise men
Well keep me com- -pa- -ny but two years moe
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
Well tell me now what la- -dy is the same
To whom you swore a se- -cret pil- -grim- -age
That you to- -- -day promis'd to tell me of?
Than my faint means would grant con- -tin- -u- -ance
From such a no- -ble rate but my chief care
Is to come fair- -ly off from the great debts
I owe the most in mon- -ey and in love
And from your love I have a war- -ran- -ty
How to get clear of all the debts I owe
I pray you good Bas- -sanio let me know it
And if it stand as you your- -self still do
With- -in the eye of hon- -our be as- -sur'd
Lie all un- -lock- -'d to your oc- -ca- -sions
The self- -- -same way with more ad- -vised watch
I oft found both I urge this child- -hood proof
Be- -cause what fol- -lows is pure in- -no- -cence
I owe you much and like a wil- -ful youth
That which I owe is lost but if you please
To shoot an- -oth- -er ar- -row that self way
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
As I will watch the aim or to find both
You know me well and here- -in spend but time
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In mak- -ing ques- -tion of my ut- -ter- -most
Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowl- -edge may by me be done
And I am prest un- -to it there- -fore speak
In Bel- -mont is a la- -dy rich- -ly left
And she is fair and fair- -er than that word
For the four winds blow in from ev- -ery coast
Hang on her tem- -ples like a gold- -en fleece
Which makes her seat of Bel- -mont Col- -chos' strond
O my An- -to- -nio had I but the means
To hold a ri- -val place with one of them
That I should ques- -tion- -less be for- -tu- -nate
Thou know'st that all my for- -tunes are at sea
Where mon- -ey is and I no ques- -tion make
But more for that in low sim- -plic- -i- -ty
The rate of us- -ance here with us in Venice
If I can catch him once up- -on the hip
He hates our sa- -cred na- -tion and he rails
Even there where mer- -chants most do con- -gre- -gate
Which he calls in- -ter- -est Cursed be my tribe
And by the near guess of my mem- -o- -ry
I can- -not in- -stant- -ly raise up the gross
Your wor- -ship was the last man in our mouths
By tak- -ing nor by giv- -ing of ex- -cess
Yet to sup- -ply the ripe wants of my friend
I had for- -got three months you told me so
Methoughts you said you nei- -ther lend nor bor- -row
When Ja- -cob graz'd his un- -cle La- -ban's sheep
As his wise moth- -er wrought in his be- -half
The third pos- -ses- -sor ay he was the third
And what of him? Did he take in- -ter- -est?
Di- -rect- -ly in- -t'rest mark what Ja- -cob did
When La- -ban and him- -self were com- -pro- -mis'd
That all the ean- -lings which were streak'd and pied
And when the work of gen- -er- -a- -tion was
Be- -tween these wool- -ly breed- -ers in the act
And in the do- -ing of the deed of kind
He stuck them up be- -fore the ful- -some ewes
Who then con- -ceiv- -ing did in ean- -ing time
This was a way to thrive and he was blest
And thrift is bless- -ing if men steal it not
I can- -not tell I make it breed as fast
Is like a vil- -lain with a smil- -ing cheek
A good- -ly ap- -ple rot- -ten at the heart
O what a good- -ly out- -side false- -hood hath!
Three months from twelve then let me see the rate
In the Ri- -al- -to you have rat- -ed me
Still have I borne it with a pa- -tient shrug
For suf- -f'rance is the badge of all our tribe
You call me mis- -be- -liev- -er cut- -throat dog
And spit up- -on my Jew- -ish gab- -er- -dine
And all for use of that which is mine own
Well then it now ap- -pears you need my help
Go to then you come to me and you say
'Shy- -lock we would have mon- -eys.' You say so
You that did void your rheum up- -on my beard
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog mon- -ey? Is it pos- -si- -ble
A cur can lend three thou- -sand ducat- -s?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bond- -man's key
With bat- -ed breath and whis- -p'ring hum- -ble- -ness
'Fair sir you spit on me on Wednes- -day last
You spurn'd me such a day an- -oth- -er time
If thou wilt lend this mon- -ey lend it not
As to thy friends for when did friend- -ship take
A breed for bar- -ren met- -al of his friend?
Who if he break thou mayst with bet- -ter face
I would be friends with you and have your love
For- -get the shames that you have stain'd me with
Go with me to a no- -tary seal me there
Your sin- -gle bond and in a mer- -ry sport
If you re- -pay me not on such a day
In such a place such sum or sums as are
Con- -tent in faith I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kind- -ness in the Jew
You shall not seal to such a bond for me
Why fear not man I will not for- -feit it
With- -in these two months that's a month be- -fore
This bond ex- -pires I do ex- -pect re- -turn
Of thrice three times the val- -ue of this bond
Whose own hard deal- -ings teach- -es them sus- -pect
If he should break his day what should I gain
By the ex- -ac- -tion of the for- -fei- -ture?
A pound of man's flesh tak- -en from a man
As flesh of mut- -tons beefs or goats I say
To buy his favour I ex- -tend this friend- -ship
And for my love I pray you wrong me not
Yes Shy- -lock I will seal un- -to this bond
Give him di- -rec- -tion for this mer- -ry bond
See to my house left in the fear- -ful guard
The He- -brew will turn Chris- -tian he grows kind
I like not fair terms and a vil- -lain's mind
Come on in this there can be no dis- -may
The shad- -owed liv- -ery of the bur- -nish'd sun
To whom I am a neigh- -bour and near bred
And let us make in- -ci- -sion for your love
To prove whose blood is red- -dest his or mine
I tell thee la- -dy this as- -pect of mine
The best- -re- -gard- -ed vir- -gins of our clime
Have lov'd it too I would not change this hue
Ex- -cept to steal your thoughts my gen- -tle queen
In terms of choice I am not sole- -ly led
By nice di- -rec- -tion of a maid- -en's eyes
Bars me the right of vol- -un- -tary choos- -ing
But if my fa- -ther had not scant- -ed me
And hedg'd me by his wit to yield my- -self
To try my for- -tune By this scim- -i- -tar
That slew the So- -phy and a Per- -sian prince
Out- -brave the heart most dar- -ing on the earth
Pluck the young suck- -ing cubs from the she- -bear
Yea mock the li- -on when 'a roars for prey
May turn by for- -tune from the weak- -er band
And so may I blind For- -tune lead- -ing me
And ei- -ther not at- -tempt to choose at all
Or swear be- -fore you choose if you choose wrong
Nev- -er to speak to la- -dy af- -ter- -ward
In way of mar- -riage there- -fore be ad- -vis'd
kind of taste well my con- -science says 'Launcelot budge
'Budge,' says the fiend 'Budge not,' says my con- -science
me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with
Er- -go Mas- -ter Launcelot Talk not of Mas- -ter
Alack sir I am sand- -blind I know you not
it though old man yet poor man my fa- -ther
I know thee well thou hast ob- -tain'd thy suit
Shy- -lock thy mas- -ter spoke with me this day
Thou speak'st it well Go fa- -ther with thy son
Take leave of thy old mas- -ter and in- -quire
More guard- -ed than his fel- -lows' see it done
Re- -turn in haste for I do feast to- -night
My best es- -teem'd ac- -quain- -tance hie thee go
My best en- -deav- -ours shall be done here- -in
Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice
And in such eyes as ours ap- -pear not faults
But where thou art not known why there they show
Some- -thing too lib- -er- -al Pray thee take pain
To al- -lay with some cold drops of mod- -esty
Talk with re- -spect and swear but now and then
Nay more while grace is say- -ing hood mine eyes
Like one well stud- -ied in a sad os- -tent
Your bold- -est suit of mirth for we have friends
That pur- -pose mer- -ri- -ment But fare you well
Didst rob it of some taste of te- -dious- -ness
But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee
Give him this let- -ter do it se- -cret- -ly
And so farewell I would not have my fa- -ther
But though I am a daugh- -ter to his blood
I am not to his man- -ners O Loren- -zo
If thou keep prom- -ise I shall end this strife
Dis- -guise us at my lodg- -ing and re- -turn
We have not spoke us yet of torch- -bear- -ers
And bet- -ter in my mind not un- -der- -took
'Tis now but four o'- -clock we have two hours
I know the hand in faith 'tis a fair hand
to- -night with my new mas- -ter the Chris- -tian
Hold here take this Tell gen- -tle Jes- -si- -ca
I will not fail her speak it pri- -vate- -ly
Will you pre- -pare you for this masque to- -night?
I am pro- -vid- -ed of a torch- -bear- -er
Was not that let- -ter from fair Jes- -si- -ca?
How I shall take her from her fa- -ther's house
What gold and jew- -els she is fur- -nish'd with
It will be for his gen- -tle daugh- -ter's sake
And nev- -er dare mis- -for- -tune cross her foot
Un- -less she do it un- -der this ex- -cuse
That she is is- -sue to a faith- -less Jew
Come go with me pe- -ruse this as thou goest
Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge
What Jes- -si- -ca! Thou shalt not gor- -man- -dize
As thou hast done with me What Jes- -si- -ca!
And sleep and snore and rend ap- -par- -el out
I am bid forth to sup- -per Jes- -si- -ca
There are my keys But where- -fore should I go?
I am not bid for love they flat- -ter me
But yet I'll go in hate to feed up- -on
The prodi- -gal Chris- -tian Jes- -si- -ca my girl
Look to my house I am right loath to go
For I did dream of mon- -ey- -bags to- -night
What are there masques? Hear you me Jes- -si- -ca
Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
Clam- -ber not you up to the case- -ments then
Nor thrust your head in- -to the pub- -lic street
To gaze on Chris- -tian fools with var- -nish'd faces
I have no mind of feast- -ing forth to- -night
What says that fool of Ha- -gar's off- -spring ha?
The patch is kind enough but a huge feed- -er
There- -fore I part with him and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His bor- -rowed purse Well Jes- -si- -ca go in
Do as I bid you shut doors af- -ter you
A proverb nev- -er stale in thrifty mind Ex- -it
To seal love's bonds new made than they are wont
That he did pace them first? All things that are
Hug- -g'd and em- -braced by the strum- -pet wind
Lean rent and beg- -gar'd by the strum- -pet wind!
Not I but my af- -fairs have made you wait
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives
Here dwells my fa- -ther Jew Ho! who's with- -in?
Who are you? Tell me for more cer- -tain- -ty
Al- -beit I'll swear that I do know your tongue
For who love I so much? And now who knows
Here catch this cas- -ket it is worth the pains
The pret- -ty fol- -lies that them- -selves com- -mit
For if they could Cu- -pid him- -self would blush
De- -scend for you must be my torch- -bear- -er
What! must I hold a can- -dle to my shames?
They in them- -selves good sooth are too too light
Why 'tis an of- -fice of dis- -cov- -ery love
Even in the love- -ly gar- -nish of a boy
And we are stay'd for at Bas- -san- -io's feast
I will make fast the doors and gild my- -self
Now by my hood a gen- -tle and no Jew
For she is wise if I can judge of her
And fair she is if that mine eyes be true
And true she is as she hath prov'd her- -self
And there- -fore like her- -self wise fair and true
Ex- -it with JES- -SI- -CA and SA- -LE- -RIO
'Tis nine o'- -clock our friends all stay for you
I have sent twen- -ty out to seek for you
Go draw aside the cur- -tains and dis- -cov- -er
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men de- -sire.'
This third dull lead with warn- -ing all as blunt
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
The one of them con- -tains my pic- -ture Prince
If you choose that then I am yours with- -al
I will sur- -vey th' in- -scrip- -tions back again
Must give for what? For lead? Haz- -ard for lead!
This cas- -ket threat- -ens men that haz- -ard all
A gold- -en mind stoops not to shows of dross
I'll then nor give nor haz- -ard aught for lead
What says the sil- -ver with her vir- -gin hue?
And yet to be afeard of my de- -serv- -ing
In graces and in qual- -i- -ties of breed- -ing
But more than these in love I do de- -serve
What if I stray'd no far- -ther but chose here?
Let's see once more this say- -ing grav'd in gold
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men de- -sire.'
From the four cor- -ners of the earth they come
To kiss this shrine this mor- -tal- -breath- -ing saint
The Hyr- -ca- -ni- -an deserts and the vasty wilds
The wa- -tery king- -dom whose am- -bi- -tious head
Spits in the face of heav- -en is no bar
To stop the for- -eign spir- -its but they come
Is't like that lead con- -tains her? 'Twere damna- -tion
To think so base a thought it were too gross
To rib her cere- -cloth in the ob- -scure grave
Or shall I think in sil- -ver she's im- -mur'd
O sin- -ful thought! Nev- -er so rich a gem
Stam- -p'd in gold but that's in- -sculp'd up- -on
But here an an- -gel in a gold- -en bed
Lies all with- -in De- -liv- -er me the key
Here do I choose and thrive I as I may!
There take it Prince and if my form lie there
A car- -rion Death with- -in whose emp- -ty eye
Ex- -it with his train Flour- -ish of cor- -nets
A gen- -tle rid- -dance Draw the cur- -tains go
The vil- -lain Jew with out- -cries rais'd the Duke
Who went with him to search Bas- -san- -io's ship
He came too late the ship was un- -der sail
Be- -sides An- -to- -nio cer- -ti- -fied the Duke
I nev- -er heard a pas- -sion so con- -fus'd
As the dog Jew did ut- -ter in the streets
Jus- -tice! the law! My ducats and my daugh- -ter!
Stol'n by my daugh- -ter! Jus- -tice! Find the girl
Cry- -ing his stones his daugh- -ter and his ducats
Let good An- -to- -nio look he keep his day
I rea- -son'd with a French- -man yes- -ter- -day
Who told me in the nar- -row seas that part
A ves- -sel of our coun- -try rich- -ly fraught
And wish'd in si- -lence that it were not his
Of his re- -turn He an- -swered 'Do not so
Slub- -ber not busi- -ness for my sake Bas- -sanio
Let it not en- -ter in your mind of love
As shall con- -ve- -nient- -ly be- -come you there.'
And even there his eye be- -ing big with tears
And with af- -fec- -tion won- -drous sen- -si- -ble
I think he on- -ly loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out
Quick quick I pray thee draw the cur- -tain straight
Be- -hold there stand the cas- -kets no- -ble Prince
If you choose that where- -in I am con- -tain'd
Straight shall our nup- -tial rites be sol- -em- -niz'd
But if you fail with- -out more speech my lord
Of the right cas- -ket nev- -er in my life
If I do fail in for- -tune of my choice
To these in- -junc- -tions ev- -ery one doth swear
That comes to haz- -ard for my worth- -less self
And so have I ad- -dress'd me For- -tune now
To my heart's hope! Gold sil- -ver and base lead
What says the gold- -en chest? Ha! let me see
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men de- -sire.'
What many men de- -sire that 'many' may be meant
By the fool mul- -ti- -tude that choose by show
Not learn- -ing more than the fond eye doth teach
Builds in the weath- -er on the out- -ward wall
And rank me with the bar- -barous mul- -ti- -tudes
Tell me once more what ti- -tle thou dost bear
To be new var- -nish'd! Well but to my choice
And in- -stant- -ly un- -lock my for- -tunes here
[Aside] Too long a pause for that which you find
How much un- -like art thou to Por- -ti- -a!
Did I de- -serve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? Are my deserts no bet- -ter?
To of- -fend and judge are dis- -tinct of- -fices
They have the wis- -dom by their wit to lose
Gifts of rich val- -ue Yet I have not seen
To show how cost- -ly sum- -mer was at hand
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
Come come Ner- -is- -sa for I long to see
Quick Cu- -pid's post that comes so man- -ner- -ly
How now Shy- -lock? What news among the mer- -chants?
match'd un- -less the dev- -il him- -self turn Jew
How now Tubal what news from Genoa? Hast thou found
I thank thee good Tubal Good news good news ha
again Fourscore ducats at a sit- -ting! Fourscore ducat- -s!
But An- -to- -nio is cer- -tain- -ly un- -done
Nay that's true that's very true Go Tubal fee me
good Tubal at our syn- -a- -gogue Tubal Exe- -unt
I pray you tar- -ry pause a day or two
Be- -fore you haz- -ard for in choos- -ing wrong
There's some- -thing tells me but it is not love
I would not lose you and you know your- -self
Hate coun- -sels not in such a qual- -i- -ty
But lest you should not un- -der- -stand me well
And yet a maid- -en hath no tongue but thought
I would de- -tain you here some month or two
How to choose right but then I am for- -sworn
But if you do you'll make me wish a sin
That I had been for- -sworn Beshrew your eye- -s!
They have o'er- -look'd me and di- -vid- -ed me
Mine own I would say but if mine then yours
Puts bars be- -tween the own- -ers and their rights
Let for- -tune go to hell for it not I
I speak too long but 'tis to peize the time
To eke it and to draw it out in length
For as I am I live up- -on the rack
Up- -on the rack Bas- -san- -io? Then con- -fess
What trea- -son there is min- -gled with your love
None but that ug- -ly trea- -son of mis- -trust
'Tween snow and fire as trea- -son and my love
Ay but I fear you speak up- -on the rack
Prom- -ise me life and I'll con- -fess the truth
Had been the very sum of my con- -fes- -sion
O hap- -py tor- -ment when my tor- -tur- -er
Doth teach me an- -swers for de- -liv- -er- -ance!
Away then I am lock- -'d in one of them
If you do love me you will find me out
Let mu- -sic sound while he doth make his choice
And what is mu- -sic then? Then mu- -sic is
Even as the flour- -ish when true sub- -jects bow
As are those dul- -cet sounds in break of day
That creep in- -to the dream- -ing bride- -groom's ear
And sum- -mon him to mar- -riage Now he goes
With no less pres- -ence but with much more love
The vir- -gin trib- -ute paid by howl- -ing Troy
The is- -sue of th' ex- -ploit Go Her- -cules!
Live thou I live With much much more dis- -may
I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray
So may the out- -ward shows be least them- -selves
The world is still de- -ceiv'd with or- -na- -ment
In law what plea so taint- -ed and cor- -rupt
But be- -ing sea- -son'd with a gra- -cious voice
Ob- -scures the show of evil? In re- -li- -gion
Will bless it and ap- -prove it with a text
There is no vice so sim- -ple but as- -sumes
How many cow- -ards whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand wear yet up- -on their chins
Who in- -ward search'd have liv- -ers white as milk!
And these as- -sume but val- -our's ex- -cre- -ment
And you shall see 'tis pur- -chas'd by the weight
Mak- -ing them light- -est that wear most of it
Which make such wan- -ton gam- -bols with the wind
The seem- -ing truth which cun- -ning times put on
Hard food for Mi- -das I will none of thee
Nor none of thee thou pale and com- -mon drudge
'Tween man and man but thou thou mea- -gre lead
And here choose I Joy be the con- -se- -quence!
As doubt- -ful thoughts and rash- -em- -brac'd de- -spair
In mea- -sure rain thy joy scant this ex- -cess!
I feel too much thy bless- -ing Make it less
Hath come so near cre- -ation? Move these eye- -s?
Seem they in mo- -tion? Here are sev- -er'd lips
Part- -ed with sug- -ar breath so sweet a bar
Should sun- -der such sweet friends Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spi- -der and hath wo- -ven
Doth limp be- -hind the sub- -stance Here's the scroll
A gen- -tle scroll Fair la- -dy by your leave
I come by note to give and to re- -ceive
Like one of two con- -tend- -ing in a prize
That thinks he hath done well in peo- -ple's eyes
So thrice- -- -fair la- -dy stand I even so
I would not be am- -bi- -tious in my wish
To wish my- -self much bet- -ter yet for you
I would be tre- -bled twen- -ty times my- -self
That on- -ly to stand high in your ac- -count
Ex- -ceed ac- -count But the full sum of me
Is sum of some- -thing which to term in gross
Is an un- -lesson'd girl un- -school'd un- -prac- -tis'd
Hap- -py in this she is not yet so old
She is not bred so dull but she can learn
As from her lord her gov- -er- -nor her king
My- -self and what is mine to you and yours
This house these ser- -vants and this same my- -self
Are yours my lord's I give them with this ring
And be my van- -tage to ex- -claim on you
On- -ly my blood speaks to you in my veins
Turns to a wild of noth- -ing save of joy
Ex- -press'd and not ex- -press'd But when this ring
Parts from this fin- -ger then parts life from hence
O then be bold to say Bas- -san- -io's dead!
My lord and la- -dy it is now our time
My Lord Bas- -sanio and my gen- -tle la- -dy
I wish you all the joy that you can wish
For I am sure you can wish none from me
And when your hon- -ours mean to sol- -em- -nize
Even at that time I may be mar- -ried too
With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
I thank your lord- -ship you have got me one
My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
You saw the mis- -tress I be- -held the maid
No more per- -tains to me my lord than you
Your for- -tune stood up- -on the cas- -kets there
And so did mine too as the mat- -ter falls
With oaths of love at last if prom- -ise last
I got a prom- -ise of this fair one here
Loren- -zo and Sa- -le- -rio wel- -come hith- -er
If that the youth of my new in- -t'rest here
I thank your hon- -our For my part my lord
My pur- -pose was not to have seen you here
But meet- -ing with Sa- -le- -rio by the way
He did en- -treat me past all say- -ing nay
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
Not sick my lord un- -less it be in mind
Nor well un- -less in mind his let- -ter there
Ner- -is- -sa cheer yond stranger bid her wel- -come
Your hand Sa- -le- -rio What's the news from Venice?
I know he will be glad of our suc- -cess
We are the Ja- -sons we have won the fleece
Some dear friend dead else noth- -ing in the world
And I must freely have the half of any- -thing
When I did first im- -part my love to you
Ran in my veins I was a gen- -tle- -man
Rat- -ing my- -self at noth- -ing you shall see
That I was worse than noth- -ing for in- -deed
I have en- -gag'd my- -self to a dear friend
En- -gag'd my friend to his mere en- -e- -my
And ev- -ery word in it a gap- -ing wound
Hath all his ven- -tures fail'd? What not one hit?
From Tripo- -lis from Mex- -i- -co and Eng- -land
And not one ves- -sel scape the dread- -ful touch
Be- -sides it should ap- -pear that if he had
He would not take it Nev- -er did I know
A crea- -ture that did bear the shape of man
He plies the Duke at morn- -ing and at night
And doth im- -peach the free- -dom of the state
Of for- -fei- -ture of jus- -tice and his bond
When I was with him I have heard him swear
Than twen- -ty times the val- -ue of the sum
That he did owe him and I know my lord
The dear- -est friend to me the kind- -est man
In do- -ing cour- -te- -sies and one in whom
The an- -cient Ro- -man hon- -our more ap- -pears
Pay him six thou- -sand and de- -face the bond
Dou- -ble six thou- -sand and then tre- -ble that
First go with me to church and call me wife
With an un- -qui- -et soul You shall have gold
To pay the pet- -ty debt twen- -ty times over
My maid Ner- -is- -sa and my- -self mean- -time
For you shall hence up- -on your wed- -ding day
Bid your friends wel- -come show a mer- -ry cheer
Since you are dear bought I will love you dear
But let me hear the let- -ter of your friend
O love dis- -patch all busi- -ness and be gone!
This is the fool that lent out mon- -ey gratis
But since I am a dog be- -ware my fangs
I'll have my bond I will not hear thee speak
I'll have my bond and there- -fore speak no more
To shake the head re- -lent and sigh and yield
To Chris- -tian in- -ter- -ces- -sors Fol- -low not
It is the most im- -pen- -e- -tra- -ble cur
I'll fol- -low him no more with boot- -less prayers
He seeks my life his rea- -son well I know
I oft de- -liv- -er'd from his for- -fei- -tures
Will nev- -er grant this for- -fei- -ture to hold
The Duke can- -not de- -ny the course of law
Will much im- -peach the jus- -tice of the state
Since that the trade and prof- -it of the city
Con- -sis- -teth of all na- -tions There- -fore go
These griefs and loss- -es have so bat- -ed me
That I shall hard- -ly spare a pound of flesh
To- -- -mor- -row to my bloody cred- -i- -tor
Madam al- -though I speak it in your pres- -ence
You have a no- -ble and a true con- -ceit
In bear- -ing thus the ab- -sence of your lord
How true a gen- -tle- -man you send re- -lief
How dear a lover of my lord your hus- -band
I know you would be proud- -er of the work
Than cus- -tom- -ary boun- -ty can en- -force you
I nev- -er did re- -pent for do- -ing good
Must needs be like my lord If it be so
How lit- -tle is the cost I have be- -stowed
In pur- -chas- -ing the sem- -blance of my soul
This comes too near the prais- -ing of my- -self
There- -fore no more of it hear oth- -er things
Un- -til my lord's re- -turn for mine own part
On- -ly at- -tend- -ed by Ner- -is- -sa here
Un- -til her hus- -band and my lord's re- -turn
And there we will abide I do de- -sire you
The which my love and some ne- -ces- -si- -ty
And will ac- -knowl- -edge you and Jes- -si- -ca
Fair thoughts and hap- -py hours at- -tend on you!
I wish your la- -dy- -ship all heart's con- -tent
I thank you for your wish and am well pleas'd
As I have ev- -er found thee hon- -est- -true
In speed to Pad- -ua see thou ren- -der this
In- -to my cous- -in's hands Doc- -tor Bel- -lario
Come on Ner- -is- -sa I have work in hand
They shall Ner- -is- -sa but in such a habit
With that we lack I'll hold thee any wa- -ger
When we are both ac- -cou- -tred like young men
And speak be- -tween the change of man and boy
With a reed voice and turn two minc- -ing steps
In- -to a man- -ly stride and speak of frays
Like a fine brag- -ging youth and tell quaint lies
I could not do with- -al Then I'll re- -pent
About a twelve- -month I have with- -in my mind
A thou- -sand raw tricks of these brag- -ging Jacks
But come I'll tell thee all my whole de- -vice
When I am in my coach which stays for us
moth- -er should be vis- -it- -ed up- -on me
Not so sir nei- -ther I know my du- -ty
The fool hath plant- -ed in his mem- -o- -ry
How dost thou like the Lord Bas- -san- -io's wife?
He finds the joys of heav- -en here on earth
And if on earth he do not mer- -it it
And Por- -tia one there must be some- -thing else
Pawn'd with the oth- -er for the poor rude world
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
I will anon first let us go to din- -ner
A stony ad- -ver- -sary an in- -hu- -man wretch
Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qual- -i- -fy
And that no law- -ful means can car- -ry me
Out of his en- -vy's reach I do op- -pose
My pa- -tience to his fury and am ar- -m'd
To suf- -fer with a quiet- -ness of spir- -it
He is ready at the door he comes my lord
Shy- -lock the world thinks and I think so too
To the last hour of act and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mer- -cy and re- -morse more strange
Than is thy strange ap- -par- -ent cru- -el- -ty
Thou wilt not on- -ly loose the for- -fei- -ture
But touch'd with hu- -man gen- -tle- -ness and love
For- -give a moi- -ety of the prin- -ci- -pal
Glanc- -ing an eye of pity on his loss- -es
That have of late so hud- -dled on his back
And pluck com- -mis- -er- -a- -tion of his state
From stub- -born Turks and Tar- -tars nev- -er train'd
We all ex- -pect a gen- -tle an- -swer Jew
To have the due and for- -feit of my bond
If you de- -ny it let the dan- -ger light
Up- -on your char- -ter and your city's free- -dom
A weight of car- -rion flesh than to re- -ceive
What if my house be trou- -bled with a rat
And I be pleas'd to give ten thou- -sand ducats
To have it ban'd? What are you an- -swer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gap- -ing pig
Some that are mad if they be- -hold a cat
Can- -not con- -tain their urine for af- -fec- -tion
Mis- -tress of pas- -sion sways it to the mood
As there is no firm rea- -son to be rend'red
More than a lodg'd hate and a cer- -tain loathing
I bear An- -to- -nio that I fol- -low thus
A los- -ing suit against him Are you an- -swered?
This is no an- -swer thou un- -feel- -ing man
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Hates any man the thing he would not kil- -l?
Ev- -ery of- -fence is not a hate at first
What wouldst thou have a ser- -pent sting thee twice?
I pray you think you ques- -tion with the Jew
You may as well go stand up- -on the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usu- -al height
You may as well use ques- -tion with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
You may as well for- -bid the moun- -tain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise
Make no moe of- -fers use no far- -ther means
But with all brief and plain con- -ve- -nien- -cy
Let me have judg- -ment and the Jew his will
Were in six parts and ev- -ery part a ducat
I would not draw them I would have my bond
What judg- -ment shall I dread do- -ing no wrong?
Which fike your ass- -es and your dogs and mules
You use in ab- -ject and in slav- -ish parts
Be- -cause you bought them shall I say to you
'Let them be free mar- -ry them to your heirs
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
'The slaves are ours.' So do I an- -swer you
The pound of flesh which I de- -mand of him
If you de- -ny me fie up- -on your law!
There is no force in the de- -crees of Venice
Whom I have sent for to de- -ter- -mine this
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
You can- -not bet- -ter be em- -ploy'd Bas- -sanio
En- -ter NER- -IS- -SA dressed like a lawyer's clerk
Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
Thou mak'st thy knife keen but no met- -al can
Of thy sharp en- -vy Can no prayers pierce thee?
And for thy life let jus- -tice be ac- -cus'd
Thou al- -most mak'st me wa- -ver in my faith
That souls of an- -i- -mals in- -fuse them- -selves
Even from the gal- -lows did his fell soul fleet
And whilst thou layest in thy un- -hal- -lowed dam
In- -fus'd it- -self in thee for thy de- -sires
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
Thou but of- -fend'st thy lungs to speak so loud
Re- -pair thy wit good youth or it will fall
To cure- -less ru- -in I stand here for law
To know your an- -swer whether you'll ad- -mit him
And here I take it is the doc- -tor come
DUKE OF VENICE You are wel- -come take your place
Are you ac- -quaint- -ed with the dif- -fer- -ence
Which is the mer- -chant here and which the Jew?
Can- -not im- -pugn you as you do pro- -ceed
You stand with- -in his dan- -ger do you not?
On what com- -pul- -sion must I? Tell me that
The qual- -i- -ty of mer- -cy is not strain'd
Up- -on the place be- -neath It is twice blest
It bles- -seth him that gives and him that takes
Where- -in doth sit the dread and fear of kings
When mer- -cy sea- -sons jus- -tice There- -fore Jew
Though jus- -tice be thy plea con- -sid- -er this
That in the course of jus- -tice none of us
The deeds of mer- -cy I have spoke thus much
To mit- -i- -gate the jus- -tice of thy plea
Which if thou fol- -low this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sen- -tence 'gainst the mer- -chant there
My deeds up- -on my head! I crave the law
Yea twice the sum if that will not suf- -fice
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er
On for- -feit of my hands my head my heart
If this will not suf- -fice it must ap- -pear
Wrest once the law to your au- -thor- -i- -ty
To do a great right do a lit- -tle wrong
And curb this cru- -el dev- -il of his will
Will rush in- -to the state it can- -not be
A Daniel come to judg- -men- -t! Yea a Daniel!
O wise young judge how I do hon- -our thee!
I pray you let me look up- -on the bond
Here 'tis most rev- -erend Doc- -tor here it is
Shy- -lock there's thrice thy mon- -ey of- -f'red thee
And law- -ful- -ly by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh to be by him cut off
Take thrice thy mon- -ey bid me tear the bond
When it is paid ac- -cord- -ing to the tenour
It doth ap- -pear you are a wor- -thy judge
Hath been most sound I charge you by the law
Pro- -ceed to judg- -ment By my soul I swear
There is no pow- -er in the tongue of man
To al- -ter me I stay here on my bond
You must pre- -pare your bo- -som for his knife
O no- -ble judge! O ex- -cel- -lent young man!
For the in- -tent and pur- -pose of the law
So says the bond doth it not no- -ble judge?
'N- -ear- -est his heart,' those are the very words
It is so Are there bal- -ance here to weigh
Have by some sur- -geon Shy- -lock on your charge
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
Is it so nom- -i- -nat- -ed in the bond?
It is not so ex- -press'd but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for char- -i- -ty
I can- -not find it 'tis not in the bond
But lit- -tle I am ar- -m'd and well prepar'd
For here- -in For- -tune shows her- -self more kind
Than is her cus- -tom It is still her use
To let the wretch- -ed man out- -live his wealth
To view with hol- -low eye and wrin- -kled brow
Say how I lov'd you speak me fair in death
And when the tale is told bid her be judge
Re- -pent but you that you shall lose your friend
And he re- -pents not that he pays your debt
I'll pay it in- -stant- -ly with all my heart
An- -to- -nio I am mar- -ried to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life it- -self
But life it- -self my wife and all the world
I would lose all ay sac- -ri- -fice them all
Here to this dev- -il to de- -liv- -er you
Your wife would give you lit- -tle thanks for that
I would she were in heav- -en so she could
'Tis well you of- -fer it be- -hind her back
The wish would make else an un- -qui- -et house
Had been her hus- -band rather than a Chris- -tian!
The court awards it and the law doth give it
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
The law al- -lows it and the court awards it
Tar- -ry a lit- -tle there is some- -thing else
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
The words ex- -press- -ly are 'a pound of flesh.'
Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
But in the cut- -ting it if thou dost shed
One drop of Chris- -tian blood thy lands and goods
Thou shalt have jus- -tice more than thou de- -sir'st
I take this of- -fer then pay the bond thrice
The Jew shall have all jus- -tice Soft! No haste
There- -fore pre- -pare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more
As makes it light or heavy in the sub- -stance
But in the es- -ti- -ma- -tion of a hair
Now in- -fi- -del I have you on the hip
Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy for- -fei- -ture
Give me my prin- -ci- -pal and let me go
He shall have mere- -ly jus- -tice and his bond
I thank thee Jew for teach- -ing me that word
Shall I not have bare- -ly my prin- -ci- -pal?
Thou shalt have noth- -ing but the for- -fei- -ture
To be so tak- -en at thy per- -il Jew
Why then the dev- -il give him good of it!
The law hath yet an- -oth- -er hold on you
It is en- -act- -ed in the laws of Venice
That by di- -rect or in- -di- -rect at- -tempts
The par- -ty 'gainst the which he doth con- -trive
Shall seize one half his goods the oth- -er half
Of the Duke on- -ly 'gainst all oth- -er voice
That in- -di- -rect- -ly and di- -rect- -ly too
The dan- -ger for- -mer- -ly by me re- -hears'd
Down there- -fore and beg mer- -cy of the Duke
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thy- -self
Thou hast not left the val- -ue of a cord
There- -fore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge
Which hum- -ble- -ness may drive un- -to a fine
Nay take my life and all par- -don not that
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sus- -tain my house you take my life
When you do take the means where- -by I live
A hal- -ter gratis noth- -ing else for God's sake!
So please my lord the Duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods
I am con- -tent so he will let me have
The oth- -er half in use to ren- -der it
Up- -on his death un- -to the gen- -tle- -man
Two things pro- -vid- -ed more that for this favour
Here in the court of all he dies pos- -sess'd
Un- -to his son Loren- -zo and his daugh- -ter
Art thou con- -tent- -ed Jew? What dost thou say?
I pray you give me leave to go from hence
I am not well send the deed af- -ter me
Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
I humbly do de- -sire your Grace of par- -don
An- -to- -nio grat- -i- -fy this gen- -tle- -man
For in my mind you are much bound to him
Most wor- -thy gen- -tle- -man I and my friend
We freely cope your cour- -te- -ous pains with- -al
In love and ser- -vice to you ev- -er- -more
He is well paid that is well sat- -is- -fied
And there- -in do ac- -count my- -self well paid
My mind was nev- -er yet more mer- -ce- -nary
I wish you well and so I take my leave
Not as fee Grant me two things I pray you
Not to de- -ny me and to par- -don me
You press me far and there- -fore I will yield
Do not draw back your hand I'll take no more
And you in love shall not de- -ny me this
This ring good sir alas it is a tri- -fle
I will not shame my- -self to give you this
I will have noth- -ing else but on- -ly this
And now me- -thinks I have a mind to it
The dear- -est ring in Venice will I give you
On- -ly for this I pray you par- -don me
You taught me first to beg and now me- -thinks
And when she put it on she made me vow
That 's- -cuse serves many men to save their gifts
And if your wife be not a mad wom- -an
And know how well I have de- -serv'd this ring
Let his de- -serv- -ings and my love with- -al
Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst
And in the morn- -ing ear- -ly will we both
And be a day be- -fore our hus- -bands home
This deed will be well wel- -come to Loren- -zo
Hath sent you here this ring and doth en- -treat
His ring I do ac- -cept most thank- -ful- -ly
And so I pray you tell him Fur- -ther- -more
Come good sir will you show me to this house?
The moon shines bright In such a night as this
When the sweet wind did gen- -tly kiss the trees
And they did make no noise in such a night
And sigh'd his soul to- -ward the Gre- -cian tents
Did This- -by fear- -ful- -ly o'er- -trip the dew
And saw the li- -on's shad- -ow ere him- -self
Stood Di- -do with a wil- -low in her hand
Up- -on the wild sea- -banks and waft her love
And with an un- -thrift love did run from Venice
Slan- -der her love and he for- -gave it her
I would out- -- -night you did no body come
But hark I hear the foot- -ing of a man
Who comes so fast in si- -lence of the night?
A friend! What friend? Your name I pray you friend?
My mis- -tress will be- -fore the break of day
I pray you is my mas- -ter yet re- -turn'd?
He is not nor we have not heard from him
But go we in I pray thee Jes- -si- -ca
Some wel- -come for the mis- -tress of the house
And yet no mat- -ter why should we go in?
With- -in the house your mis- -tress is at hand
How sweet the moon- -light sleeps up- -on this bank!
Creep in our ears soft still- -ness and the night
Be- -come the touch- -es of sweet har- -mo- -ny
There's not the small- -est orb which thou be- -hold'st
But in his mo- -tion like an an- -gel sings
Such har- -mo- -ny is in im- -mor- -tal souls
But whilst this mud- -dy ves- -ture of de- -cay
With sweet- -est touch- -es pierce your mis- -tress' ear
For do but note a wild and wan- -ton herd
Or race of youth- -ful and un- -han- -dled colts
Which is the hot con- -di- -tion of their blood
If they but hear per- -chance a trum- -pet sound
Their sav- -age eyes turn'd to a mod- -est gaze
Did feign that Or- -pheus drew trees stones and floods
Since nought so stock- -ish hard and full of rage
The man that hath no mu- -sic in him- -self
Nor is not mov'd with con- -cord of sweet sounds
Is fit for trea- -sons strat- -a- -gems and spoils
That light we see is burn- -ing in my hall
A sub- -sti- -tute shines bright- -ly as a king
Un- -til a king be by and then his state
Emp- -ties it- -self as doth an in- -land brook
In- -to the main of wa- -ters Mu- -sic! hark!
Noth- -ing is good I see with- -out re- -spect
Me- -thinks it sounds much sweet- -er than by day
The crow doth sing as sweet- -ly as the lark
When nei- -ther is at- -tend- -ed and I think
When ev- -ery goose is cack- -ling would be thought
No bet- -ter a mu- -si- -cian than the wren
Which speed we hope the bet- -ter for our words
But there is come a mes- -sen- -ger be- -fore
Give or- -der to my ser- -vants that they take
This night me- -thinks is but the day- -light sick
Such as the day is when the sun is hid
If you would walk in ab- -sence of the sun
Let me give light but let me not be light
For a light wife doth make a heavy hus- -band
I thank you madam give wel- -come to my friend
To whom I am so in- -fin- -ite- -ly bound
You should in all sense be much bound to him
For as I hear he was much bound for you
No more than I am well ac- -quit- -ted of
It must ap- -pear in oth- -er ways than words
Would he were gelt that had it for my part
Since you do take it love so much at heart
A quar- -rel ho al- -ready! What's the mat- -ter?
For all the world like cut- -ler's po- -et- -ry
Up- -on a knife 'Love me and leave me not.'
What talk you of the posy or the val- -ue?
You swore to me when I did give it you
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave
He will an if he live to be a man
Ay if a wom- -an live to be a man
Now by this hand I gave it to a youth
I could not for my heart de- -ny it him
You were to blame I must be plain with you
To part so slight- -ly with your wife's first gift
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Nev- -er to part with it and here he stands
Nor pluck it from his fin- -ger for the wealth
That the world mas- -ters Now in faith Gra- -tiano
An 'twere to me I should be mad at it
And swear I lost the ring de- -fend- -ing it
De- -serv'd it too and then the boy his clerk
And nei- -ther man nor mas- -ter would take aught
Not that I hope which you re- -ceiv'd of me
If I could add a lie un- -to a fault
Hath not the ring up- -on it it is gone
By heav- -en I will ne'er come in your bed
If you did know to whom I gave the ring
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would con- -ceive for what I gave the ring
And how un- -will- -ing- -ly I left the ring
When nought would be ac- -cept- -ed but the ring
You would abate the strength of your dis- -plea- -sure
Or half her wor- -thi- -ness that gave the ring
Or your own hon- -our to con- -tain the ring
You would not then have part- -ed with the ring
What man is there so much un- -rea- -son- -able
If you had pleas'd to have de- -fend- -ed it
With any terms of zeal want- -ed the mod- -esty
To urge the thing held as a cer- -e- -mony?
Ner- -is- -sa teach- -es me what to be- -lieve
I'll die for't but some wom- -an had the ring
And suf- -fer- -'d him to go dis- -pleas'd away
My hon- -our would not let in- -grat- -i- -tude
Let not that doc- -tor e'er come near my house
Since he hath got the jew- -el that I loved
And that which you did swear to keep for me
I will be- -come as lib- -er- -al as you
Know him I shall I am well sure of it
Now by mine hon- -our which is yet mine own
I'll have that doc- -tor for mine bed- -fel- -low
And I his clerk there- -fore be well ad- -vis'd
Well do you so let not me take him then
For if I do I'll mar the young clerk's pen
I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
In both my eyes he dou- -bly sees him- -self
In each eye one swear by your dou- -ble self
Par- -don this fault and by my soul I swear
I nev- -er more will break an oath with thee
Which but for him that had your hus- -band's ring
Had quite mis- -car- -ried I dare be bound again
My soul up- -on the for- -feit that your lord
Will nev- -er more break faith ad- -vis- -ed- -ly
Then you shall be his sure- -ty Give him this
I had it of him Par- -don me Bas- -sanio
For by this ring the doc- -tor lay with me
In lieu of this last night did lie with me
Why this is like the mend- -ing of high- -ways
Here is a let- -ter read it at your leisure
Shall wit- -ness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now re- -turn'd I have not yet
And I have bet- -ter news in store for you
Than you ex- -pect Un- -seal this let- -ter soon
Are rich- -ly come to har- -bour sud- -den- -ly
You shall not know by what strange ac- -ci- -dent
Were you the doc- -tor and I knew you not?
Un- -less he live un- -til he be a man
Sweet doc- -tor you shall be my bed- -fel- -low
When I am ab- -sent then lie with my wife
For here I read for cer- -tain that my ships
My clerk hath some good com- -forts too for you
Ay and I'll give them him with- -out a fee
There do I give to you and Jes- -si- -ca
From the rich Jew a spe- -cial deed of gift
And we will an- -swer all things faith- -ful- -ly
That my Ner- -is- -sa shall be sworn on is
But were the day come I should wish it dark
Till I were couch- -ing with the doc- -tor's clerk
Well while I live I'll fear no oth- -er thing
