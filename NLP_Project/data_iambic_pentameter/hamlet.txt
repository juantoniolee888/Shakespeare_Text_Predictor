Nay an- -swer me stand and un- -fold your- -self
You come most care- -ful- -ly up- -on your hour
For this re- -lief much thanks 'tis bit- -ter cold
The ri- -vals of my watch bid them make haste
I think I hear them. tand ho! Who is there?
And will not let be- -lief take hold of him
Touch- -ing this dread- -ed sight twice seen of us
With us to watch the min- -utes of this night
He may ap- -prove our eyes and speak to it
That are so for- -ti- -fied against our sto- -ry
When yond same star that's west- -ward from the pole
Where now it burns Mar- -cel- -lus and my- -self
In the same fig- -ure like the king that's dead
To- -geth- -er with that fair and war- -like form
Is not this some- -thing more than fan- -ta- -sy?
Be- -fore my God I might not this be- -lieve
He smote the sled- -ded Po- -lacks on the ice
Thus twice be- -fore and jump at this dead hour
With mar- -tial stalk hath he gone by our watch
But in the gross and scope of my opin- -ion
Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
Why this same strict and most ob- -ser- -vant watch
So night- -ly toils the sub- -ject of the land
And why such dai- -ly cast of brazen can- -non
And for- -eign mart for im- -ple- -ments of war
Why such im- -press of ship- -wrights whose sore task
Does not di- -vide the Sun- -day from the week
At least the whis- -per goes so Our last king
Whose im- -age even but now ap- -pear'd to us
Did for- -feit with his life all those his lands
To the in- -her- -i- -tance of Fort- -in- -bras
And car- -riage of the ar- -ti- -cle de- -sign'd
Hath in the skirts of Nor- -way here and there
Shark'd up a list of law- -less res- -o- -lutes
For food and di- -et to some en- -ter- -prise
As it doth well ap- -pear un- -to our state
But to re- -cov- -er of us by strong hand
And terms com- -pul- -sato- -ry those fore- -said lands
Is the main mo- -tive of our prepa- -ra- -tions
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post- -haste and ro- -mage in the land
I think it be no oth- -er but e'en so
That was and is the ques- -tion of these wars
A mote it is to trou- -ble the mind's eye
A lit- -tle ere the might- -i- -est Julius fell
Did squeak and gib- -ber in the Ro- -man streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Dis- -as- -ters in the sun and the moist star
As har- -bin- -gers pre- -ced- -ing still the fates
Un- -to our cli- -ma- -ture and coun- -try- -men
That may to thee do ease and race to me
Or if thou hast up- -hoard- -ed in thy life
Ex- -tort- -ed trea- -sure in the womb of earth
Shall I strike at it with my par- -ti- -san?
To of- -fer it the show of vi- -o- -lence
Up- -on a fear- -ful sum- -mons I have heard
The cock that is the trum- -pet to the morn
Awake the god of day and at his warn- -ing
The ex- -trav- -a- -gant and erring spir- -it hies
To his con- -fine and of the truth here- -in
It fad- -ed on the crow- -ing of the cock
Some say that ev- -er 'gainst that sea- -son comes
Where- -in our Saviour's birth is cel- -e- -brat- -ed
And then they say no spir- -it dare stir abroad
The nights are whole- -some then no plan- -ets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath pow- -er to charm
So hal- -low'd and so gra- -cious is the time
But look the morn in rus- -set man- -tle clad
Walks o'er the dew of yon high east- -ward hill
Break we our watch up and by my ad- -vice
Let us im- -part what we have seen to- -night
Un- -to young Ham- -let for up- -on my life
This spir- -it dumb to us will speak to him
Let's do't I pray and I this morn- -ing know
Where we shall find him most con- -ve- -nient- -ly
Though yet of Ham- -let our dear broth- -er's death
To be con- -tract- -ed in one brow of woe
That we with wis- -est sor- -row think on him
To- -geth- -er with re- -mem- -brance of our- -selves
There- -fore our some- -time sis- -ter now our queen
Have we as 'twere with a de- -feat- -ed joy
With an aus- -pi- -cious and one drop- -ping eye
Now fol- -lows that you know young Fort- -in- -bras
Hold- -ing a weak sup- -pos- -al of our worth
Or think- -ing by our late dear broth- -er's death
Our state to be dis- -joint and out of frame
Col- -leagued with this dream of his ad- -van- -tage
He hath not fail'd to pester us with mes- -sage
Im- -port- -ing the sur- -ren- -der of those lands
Lost by his fa- -ther with all bonds of law
To our most valiant broth- -er So much for him
Thus much the busi- -ness is: e have here writ
To Nor- -way un- -cle of young Fort- -in- -bras
Who im- -po- -tent and bed- -rid scarce- -ly hears
His fur- -ther gait here- -in in that the levies
The lists and full pro- -por- -tions are all made
To busi- -ness with the king more than the scope
Of these di- -lat- -ed ar- -ti- -cles al- -low
Farewell and let your haste com- -mend your du- -ty
You can- -not speak of rea- -son to the Dane
The head is not more na- -tive to the heart
The hand more in- -stru- -men- -tal to the mouth
To show my du- -ty in your coro- -na- -tion
Yet now I must con- -fess that du- -ty done
My thoughts and wish- -es bend again to- -ward France
Have you your fa- -ther's leave? What says Polo- -nius?
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
Up- -on his will I seal'd my hard con- -sent
I do be- -seech you give him leave to go
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Seek for thy no- -ble fa- -ther in the dust
Thou know'st 'tis com- -mon, ll that lives must die
Why seems it so par- -tic- -u- -lar with thee?
Nor windy sus- -pi- -ra- -tion of for- -c'd breath
No nor the fruit- -ful riv- -er in the eye
To- -geth- -er with all forms moods shows of grief
For they are ac- -tions that a man might play
But I have that with- -in which pas- -seth show
These but the trap- -pings and the suits of woe
In ob- -sti- -nate con- -dole- -ment is a course
An un- -der- -stand- -ing sim- -ple and un- -school'd
A fault against the dead a fault to na- -ture
To rea- -son most ab- -surd whose com- -mon theme
Is death of fa- -thers and who still hath cried
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
This un- -pre- -vail- -ing woe and think of us
And with no less no- -bil- -i- -ty of love
Than that which dear- -est fa- -ther bears his son
In go- -ing back to school in Wit- -ten- -berg
It is most ret- -ro- -grade to our de- -sire
And we be- -seech you bend you to re- -main
Here in the cheer and com- -fort of our eye
Let not thy moth- -er lose her prayers Ham- -let
Why 'tis a lov- -ing and a fair re- -ply
Sits smil- -ing to my heart in grace where- -of
But the great can- -non to the clouds shall tell
And the king's rouse the heav- -en shall bruit again
Re- -s- -peak- -ing earth- -ly thun- -der Come away
O that this too too sol- -id flesh would melt
Thaw and re- -solve it- -self in- -to a dew!
Or that the Ev- -er- -last- -ing had not fix'd
Seem to me all the us- -es of this world!
But two months dead! ay not so much not two
So ex- -cel- -lent a king that was to this
A lit- -tle month or ere those shoes were old
With which she fol- -lowed my poor fa- -ther's body
Would have mourn'd longer, ar- -ried with mine un- -cle
Ere yet the salt of most un- -righ- -teous tears
It is not nor it can- -not come to good
But break my heart, or I must hold my tongue!
Sir my good friend I'll change that name with you
I am very glad to see you. ood even sir
But what in faith make you from Wit- -ten- -berg?
A tru- -ant dis- -po- -si- -tion good my lord
I would not hear your en- -e- -my say so
Nor shall you do my ear that vi- -o- -lence
Against your- -self I know you are no tru- -ant
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you de- -part
In- -deed my lord it fol- -low'd hard up- -on
I saw him once he was a good- -ly king
He was a man take him for all in all
Up- -on the wit- -ness of these gen- -tle- -men
Two nights to- -geth- -er had these gen- -tle- -men
In the dead vast and mid- -dle of the night
Goes slow and state- -ly by them thrice he walk'd
By their op- -press'd and fear- -- -sur- -prised eyes
Al- -most to jel- -ly with the act of fear
Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
In dread- -ful se- -cre- -cy im- -part they did
And I with them the third night kept the watch
Where as they had de- -liv- -er'd both in time
Form of the thing each word made true and good
The ap- -pari- -tion comes I knew your fa- -ther
My lord up- -on the plat- -form where we watch'd
It lift- -ed up it head and did ad- -dress
It- -self to mo- -tion like as it would speak
As I do live my hon- -our'd lord 'tis true
In- -deed in- -deed sirs but this trou- -bles me
It was as I have seen it in his life
I'll speak to it though hell it- -self should gape
And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
If you have hith- -er- -to con- -ceal'd this sight
Let it be ten- -able in your si- -lence still
And what- -so- -ev- -er else shall hap to- -night
Give it an un- -der- -stand- -ing but no tongue
I will re- -quite your loves So fare ye well
I doubt some foul play would the night were come!
Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
Though all the earth o'er- -whelm them to men's eyes
And sis- -ter as the winds give ben- -e- -fit
And con- -voy is as- -sis- -tant do not sleep
For Ham- -let and the tri- -fling of his favour
Hold it a fash- -ion and a toy in blood
For- -ward not per- -ma- -nent sweet not last- -ing
The per- -fume and sup- -pli- -ance of a minute
The in- -ward ser- -vice of the mind and soul
Grows wide with- -al Per- -haps he loves you now
And now no soil nor cau- -tel doth be- -smirch
His great- -ness weigh'd his will is not his own
For he him- -self is sub- -ject to his birth
He may not as un- -val- -u'd per- -sons do
Carve for him- -self for on his choice de- -pends
And there- -fore must his choice be cir- -cum- -scrib'd
Un- -to the voice and yield- -ing of that body
Than the main voice of Den- -mark goes with- -al
Then weigh what loss your hon- -our may sus- -tain
If with too cre- -dent ear you list his songs
Or lose your heart or your chaste trea- -sure open
To his un- -mas- -ter'd im- -por- -tu- -ni- -ty
Fear it Ophe- -lia fear it my dear sis- -ter
Out of the shot and dan- -ger of de- -sire
If she un- -mask her beau- -ty to the moon
Too oft be- -fore their but- -tons be dis- -clos'd
And in the morn and liq- -uid dew of youth
Con- -ta- -gious blast- -ments are most im- -mi- -nent
Do not as some un- -gra- -cious pas- -tors do
Show me the steep and thorny way to heav- -en
Whilst like a puff'd and reck- -less lib- -er- -tine
Him- -self the prim- -rose path of dal- -liance treads
I stay too long: ut here my fa- -ther comes
A dou- -ble bless- -ing is a dou- -ble grace
Oc- -ca- -sion smiles up- -on a sec- -ond leave
The wind sits in the shoul- -der of your sail
And these few pre- -cepts in thy mem- -o- -ry
Look thou char- -ac- -ter Give thy thoughts no tongue
Of each new- -hatch'd un- -fledg'd com- -rade Be- -ware
Bear't that the op- -posed may be- -ware of thee
Give ev- -ery man thine ear but few thy voice
But not ex- -press'd in fan- -cy rich not gaudy
For the ap- -par- -el oft pro- -claims the man
Nei- -ther a bor- -row- -er nor a lender be
For loan oft los- -es both it- -self and friend
And bor- -row- -ing dulls the edge of hus- -bandry
This above al- -l, o thine own self be true
And it must fol- -low as the night the day
The time in- -vites you go your ser- -vants tend
And you your- -self shall keep the key of it
If it be so, s so 'tis put on me
And that in way of cau- -tion, must tell you
What is be- -tween you? give me up the truth
He hath my lord of late made many ten- -ders
Af- -fec- -tion! pooh! you speak like a green girl
Un- -sift- -ed in such per- -ilous cir- -cum- -stance
I do not know my lord what I should think
That you have ta'en these ten- -ders for true pay
Or, ot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Wrong- -ing it thus, ou'll ten- -der me a fool
My lord he hath im- -por- -tun'd me with love
With al- -most all the holy vows of heav- -en
Set your en- -treat- -ments at a high- -er rate
Be- -lieve so much in him that he is young
And with a larg- -er teth- -er may he walk
Than may be giv- -en you in few Ophe- -lia
Not of that dye which their in- -vest- -ments show
Breath- -ing like sanc- -ti- -fied and pi- -ous bawds
The bet- -ter to be- -guile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
It is a nip- -ping and an ea- -ger air
Where- -in the spir- -it held his wont to walk
The King doth wake to- -night and takes his rouse
And as he drains his draughts of Rhen- -ish down
But to my mind, hough I am na- -tive here
This heavy- -- -head- -ed rev- -el east and west
They clepe us drunk- -ards and with swin- -ish phrase
Soil our ad- -di- -tion and in- -deed it takes
From our achieve- -ments though per- -for- -m'd at height
So oft it chances in par- -tic- -u- -lar men
As in their birth, here- -in they are not guilty
Or by some habit that too much o'er- -leav- -ens
Be- -ing na- -ture's liv- -ery or for- -tune's star
As in- -fi- -nite as man may un- -der- -go
Doth all the no- -ble sub- -stance of- -ten doubt
Be thy in- -tents wicked or char- -i- -ta- -ble
King fa- -ther roy- -al Dane O an- -swer me!
Let me not burst in ig- -no- -rance but tell
Hath op'd his pon- -der- -ous and mar- -ble jaws
Mak- -ing night hideous and we fools of na- -ture
Say why is this? where- -fore? what should we do?
As if it some im- -part- -ment did de- -sire
It will not speak then will I fol- -low it
I do not set my life at a pin's fee
And for my soul what can it do to that
Be- -ing a thing im- -mor- -tal as it- -self?
Or to the dread- -ful sum- -mit of the cliff
That bee- -tles o'er his base in- -to the sea
Which might de- -prive your sovereign- -ty of rea- -son
And draw you in- -to mad- -ness? think of it
The very place puts toys of des- -per- -a- -tion
With- -out more mo- -tive in- -to ev- -ery brain
Still am I cal- -l'd; nhand me gen- -tle- -men
Let's fol- -low 'tis not fit thus to obey him
Have af- -ter. o what is- -sue will this come?
When I to sulph'u- -ous and tor- -ment- -ing flames
So art thou to re- -venge when thou shalt hear
Doom'd for a cer- -tain term to walk the night
I could a tale un- -fold whose light- -est word
Would har- -row up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
Like quills up- -on the fret- -ful por- -cu- -pine
To ears of flesh and blood. ist list O list!
If thou didst ev- -er thy dear fa- -ther love
Mur- -der most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and un- -nat- -u- -ral
Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift
As med- -i- -ta- -tion or the thoughts of love
Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Ham- -let hear
The ser- -pent that did sting thy fa- -ther's life
O wicked wit and gifts that have the pow- -er
So to se- -duce! on to his shame- -ful lust
From me whose love was of that dig- -ni- -ty
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
Will sate it- -self in a ce- -les- -tial bed
But soft! me- -thinks I scent the morn- -ing air
My cus- -tom al- -ways of the af- -ter- -noon
Up- -on my se- -cure hour thy un- -cle stole
And in the porch- -es of my ears did pour
The lep- -er- -ous dis- -til- -ment whose ef- -fect
Holds such an en- -mi- -ty with blood of man
That swift as quick- -sil- -ver it cour- -ses through
And with a sud- -den vigour it doth pos- -set
And curd like ea- -ger drop- -pings in- -to milk
The thin and whole- -some blood so did it mine
Most lazar- -- -like with vile and loath- -some crust
Thus was I sleep- -ing by a broth- -er's hand
Of life of crown of queen at once dis- -patch'd
Cut off even in the blos- -soms of my sin
With all my im- -per- -fec- -tions on my head
If thou hast na- -ture in thee bear it not
Let not the roy- -al bed of Den- -mark be
A couch for lux- -u- -ry and damned in- -cest
But how- -so- -ev- -er thou pur- -su'st this act
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul con- -trive
Against thy moth- -er aught leave her to heav- -en
And to those thorns that in her bo- -som lodge
In this dis- -tract- -ed globe Re- -mem- -ber thee!
Yea from the ta- -ble of my mem- -o- -ry
All saws of books all forms all pres- -sures past
With- -in the book and vol- -ume of my brain
Un- -mix'd with baser mat- -ter yes by heav- -en!
O vil- -lain vil- -lain smil- -ing damned vil- -lain!
My ta- -bles, eet it is I set it down
So un- -cle there you are Now to my word
There's ne'er a vil- -lain dwelling in all Den- -mark
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
And so with- -out more cir- -cum- -stance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
For ev- -ery man hath busi- -ness and de- -sire
Such as it is; nd for my own poor part
O'er- -mas- -ter't as you may And now good friends
Nev- -er make known what you have seen to- -night
Nev- -er to speak of this that you have seen
Nev- -er to speak of this that you have heard
O day and night but this is won- -drous strange!
And there- -fore as a stranger give it wel- -come
Than are dreamt of in your phi- -los- -o- -phy
To put an an- -tic dis- -po- -si- -tion on
Or by pro- -nounc- -ing of some doubt- -ful phrase
Or such am- -bigu- -ous giv- -ing out to note
Rest rest per- -turbed spir- -it! o gen- -tle- -men
And what so poor a man as Ham- -let is
And still your fin- -gers on your lips I pray
That ev- -er I was born to set it right!
Be- -fore You vis- -it him to make in- -quiry
Mar- -ry well said very well said Look you sir
And how and who what means and where they keep
As thus 'I know his fa- -ther and his friends
'And in part him; ut,' you may say 'not well
What forg- -eries you please mar- -ry none so rank
As may dis- -hon- -our him take heed of that
But sir such wan- -ton wild and usu- -al slips
As are com- -pan- -ions not- -ed and most known
Ay or drink- -ing fenc- -ing swear- -ing quar- -relling
That he is open to in- -con- -ti- -nen- -cy
That they may seem the taints of lib- -er- -ty
You lay- -ing these slight sul- -lies on my son
Your par- -ty in con- -verse him you would sound
He clos- -es with you in this con- -se- -quence
There fall- -ing out at ten- -nis' or per- -chance
'I saw him en- -ter such a house of sale,'
Your bait of false- -hood takes this carp of truth
And thus do we of wis- -dom and of reach
By in- -di- -rec- -tions find di- -rec- -tions out
So by my for- -mer lec- -ture and ad- -vice
Shall you my son You have me have you not?
Ob- -serve his in- -cli- -na- -tion in your- -self
Alas my lord I have been so af- -fright- -ed!
My lord as I was sewing in my cham- -ber
Lord Ham- -let, ith his dou- -blet all un- -brac'd
No hat up- -on his head his stock- -ings foul'd
Un- -gart'red and down- -- -gyved to his an- -kle
To speak of hor- -rors, e comes be- -fore me
He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Then goes he to the length of all his arm
And with his oth- -er hand thus o'er his brow
And thrice his head thus wav- -ing up and down
As it did seem to shat- -ter all his bulk
He seem'd to find his way with- -out his eyes
For out o' doors he went with- -out their help
And to the last bend- -ed their light on me
Come go with me I will go seek the king
As oft as any pas- -sion un- -der heav- -en
No my good lord but as you did com- -mand
I did re- -pel his let- -ters and de- -nied
And meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jeal- -ousy!
To cast be- -yond our- -selves in our opin- -ions
More grief to hide than hate to ut- -ter love
More- -over that we much did long to see you
The need we have to use you did pro- -voke
Re- -sem- -bles that it was What it should be
I can- -not dream of I en- -treat you both
That you vouch- -safe your rest here in our court
Some lit- -tle time so by your com- -pa- -nies
So much as from oc- -ca- -sion you may glean
Whether aught to us un- -known af- -flicts him thus
Good gen- -tle- -men he hath much talk'd of you
To show us so much gen- -try and good- -will
For the sup- -ply and prof- -it of our hope
Your vis- -i- -ta- -tion shall re- -ceive such thanks
Put your dread plea- -sures more in- -to com- -mand
And here give up our- -selves in the full bent
My too- -- -much- -changed son. o some of you
And bring these gen- -tle- -men where Ham- -let is
Heav- -ens make our pres- -ence and our prac- -tices
Th' am- -bas- -sadors from Nor- -way my good lord
Thou still hast been the fa- -ther of good news
Have I my lord? As- -sure you my good liege
I hold my du- -ty as I hold my soul
Both to my God and to my gra- -cious king
And I do think, r else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of pol- -i- -cy so sure
As it hath us'd to do, hat I have found
O speak of that that do I long to hear
Give first ad- -mit- -tance to the am- -bas- -sadors
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
Thy- -self do grace to them and bring them in
I doubt it is no oth- -er but the main
His fa- -ther's death and our o'er- -hasty mar- -riage
Say Volti- -mand what from our broth- -er Nor- -way?
Most fair re- -turn of greet- -ings and de- -sires
Up- -on our first he sent out to sup- -press
To be a prepa- -ra- -tion 'gainst the Po- -lack
But bet- -ter look'd in- -to he tru- -ly found
That so his sick- -ness age and im- -po- -tence
Was false- -ly borne in hand, ends out ar- -rests
Re- -ceives re- -buke from Nor- -way and in fine
Makes vow be- -fore his un- -cle nev- -er more
To give th' as- -say of arms against your majesty
That it might please you to give qui- -et pass
Through your do- -min- -ions for this en- -ter- -prise
On such re- -gards of safe- -ty and al- -lowance
And at our more con- -sid- -er'd time we'll read
Were noth- -ing but to waste night day and time
There- -fore since brevi- -ty is the soul of wit
I will be brief: our no- -ble son is mad
What is't but to be noth- -ing else but mad?
That he is mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity
And pity 'tis 'tis true a fool- -ish fig- -ure
Mad let us grant him then and now re- -mains
That we find out the cause of this ef- -fect
For this ef- -fect de- -fec- -tive comes by cause
Thus it re- -mains and the re- -main- -der thus
I have a daugh- -ter, ave whilst she is mine
Who in her du- -ty and obe- -di- -ence mark
'In her ex- -cel- -lent white bo- -som these &c.'
As they fell out by time by means and place
I would fain prove so But what might you think
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
As I per- -ceiv'd it I must tell you that
Be- -fore my daugh- -ter told me what might you
If I had play'd the desk or table- -- -book
What might you think? No I went round to work
And my young mis- -tress thus I did be- -speak
'Lord Ham- -let is a prince out of thy sphere
That she should lock her- -self from his re- -sort
Which done she took the fruits of my ad- -vice
Thence to a watch thence in- -to a weak- -ness
In- -to the mad- -ness where- -in now he raves
Hath there been such a time, 'd fain know that
That I have pos- -i- -tive- -ly said ''Tis so,'
Take this from this if this be oth- -er- -wise
Where truth is hid though it were hid in- -deed
Be you and I be- -hind an ar- -ras then
Let me be no as- -sis- -tant for a state
Then I would you were so hon- -est a man
as your daugh- -ter may con- -ceive: riend look to't
I mean the mat- -ter that you read my lord
Hap- -py in that we are not over- -hap- -py
None my lord but that the world's grown hon- -est
dun- -geons Den- -mark be- -ing one o' the worst
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
O there has been much throw- -ing about of brains
The rugged Pyrrhus like th' Hyr- -ca- -ni- -an beast
Hath now this dread and black com- -plex- -ion smear'd
With blood of fa- -thers moth- -ers daugh- -ters sons
Bak'd and im- -past- -ed with the parch- -ing streets
And thus o'er- -sized with co- -ag- -u- -late gore
Strik- -ing too short at Greeks his an- -tique sword
Re- -bel- -lious to his arm lies where it falls
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
Seem- -ing to feel this blow with flam- -ing top
Takes pris- -on- -er Pyrrhus' ear for lo! his sword
The bold winds speech- -less and the orb be- -low
As hush as death anon the dread- -ful thun- -der
Doth rend the re- -gion so af- -ter Pyrrhus' pause
Out out thou strum- -pet For- -tune! All you gods
Break all the spokes and fel- -lies from her wheel
With bis- -son rheum a clout up- -on that head
A blan- -ket in the alarm of fear caught up
'Gainst For- -tune's state would trea- -son have pro- -nounc'd
But if the gods them- -selves did see her then
In minc- -ing with his sword her hus- -band's limbs
The in- -stant burst of clam- -our that she made
Un- -less things mor- -tal move them not at all
O what a rogue and peas- -ant slave am I!
Is it not mon- -strous that this play- -er here
Could force his soul so to his own con- -ceit
That from her work- -ing all his vis- -age wan'd
What's Hecu- -ba to him or he to Hecu- -ba
That he should weep for her? What would he do
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
Con- -found the ig- -no- -rant and amaze in- -deed
A dull and mud- -dy- -met- -tled ras- -cal peak
And can say noth- -ing no not for a king
Up- -on whose prop- -er- -ty and most dear life
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
But I am pi- -geon- -liv- -er'd and lack gall
To make op- -pres- -sion bit- -ter or ere this
I should have fat- -ted all the re- -gion kites
Why what an ass am I! This is most brave
Must like a whore un- -pack my heart with words
For mur- -der though it have no tongue will speak
Be- -fore mine un- -cle I'll ob- -serve his looks
I'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
As he is very po- -tent with such spir- -its
More rel- -a- -tive than this. he play's the thing
Where- -in I'll catch the con- -science of the king
And can you by no drift of cir- -cum- -stance
But from what cause he will by no means speak
Nig- -gard of ques- -tion but of our de- -mands
Madam it so fell out that cer- -tain play- -ers
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And as I think they have al- -ready or- -der
And he be- -seech'd me to en- -treat your majesties
Good gen- -tle- -men give him a fur- -ther edge
And drive his pur- -pose on to these de- -lights
That he as 'twere by ac- -ci- -dent may here
And gath- -er by him as he is be- -hav'd
That your good beau- -ties be the hap- -py cause
That show of such an ex- -er- -cise may colour
And pi- -ous ac- -tion we do sug- -ar o'er
Than is my deed to my most paint- -ed word
I hear him com- -ing let's with- -draw my lord
Whether 'tis no- -bler in the mind to suf- -fer
Or to take arms against a sea of trou- -bles
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thou- -sand nat- -u- -ral shocks
De- -vout- -ly to be wish'd To die, o sleep
To sleep! per- -chance to dream: y there's the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuf- -fled off this mor- -tal coil
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The pangs of de- -spis'd love the law's de- -lay
The in- -so- -lence of of- -fice and the spurns
With a bare bod- -kin? who would these fardels bear
But that the dread of some- -thing af- -ter death
No trav- -eller re- -turn- -s, uz- -zles the will
Than fly to oth- -ers that we know not of?
Thus con- -science does make cow- -ards of us all
Is sick- -lied o'er with the pale cast of thought
And lose the name of ac- -tion. oft you now!
How does your hon- -our for this many a day?
That I have longed long to re- -de- -liv- -er
My hon- -our'd lord you know right well you did
And with them words of so sweet breath com- -pos'd
As made the things more rich their per- -fume lost
In- -deed my lord you made me be- -lieve so
The ex- -pectan- -cy and rose of the fair state
The glass of fash- -ion and the mould of form
And I of ladies most de- -ject and wretch- -ed
Like sweet bells jan- -gled out of tune and harsh
That un- -match'd form and fea- -ture of blown youth
Blast- -ed with ec- -sta- -sy O woe is me
Love! his af- -fec- -tions do not that way tend
And I do doubt the hatch and the dis- -close
Will be some dan- -ger which for to pre- -vent
Hap- -ly the seas and coun- -tries dif- -fer- -ent
This some- -thing- -set- -tled mat- -ter in his heart
Where- -on his brains still beat- -ing puts him thus
From fash- -ion of him- -self What think you on't?
It shall do well but yet do I be- -lieve
The ori- -gin and com- -mence- -ment of his grief
You need not tell us what Lord Ham- -let said
But if you hold it fit af- -ter the play
Let his queen moth- -er all alone en- -treat him
To show his grief let her be round with him
And I'll be plac'd so please you in the ear
To Eng- -land send him or con- -fine him where
Mad- -ness in great ones must not un- -watch'd go
As e'er my con- -ver- -sa- -tion cop'd with- -al
For what ad- -vance- -ment may I hope from thee
That no rev- -enue hast but thy good spir- -its
No let the can- -died tongue lick ab- -surd pomp
Where thrift may fol- -low fawn- -ing Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mis- -tress of her choice
And could of men dis- -tin- -guish her elec- -tion
Hath seal'd thee for her- -self for thou hast been
A man that For- -tune's buf- -fets and re- -wards
To sound what stop she please Give me that man
In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
As I do thee. ome- -thing too much of this
There is a play to- -night be- -fore the king
One scene of it comes near the cir- -cum- -stance
Which I have told thee of my fa- -ther's death
I pr'ythee when thou see'st that act a- -- -foot
Do not it- -self un- -ken- -nel in one speech
For I mine eyes will riv- -et to his face
And af- -ter we will both our judg- -ments join
And scape de- -tect- -ing I will pay the theft
Ay my lord they stay up- -on your pa- -tience
Come hith- -er my dear Ham- -let sit by me
Do you think I meant coun- -try mat- -ter- -s?
show he'll not shame to tell you what it means
You are naught you are naught I'll mark the play
Full thir- -ty times hath Phoe- -bus' cart gone round
Since love our hearts and Hy- -men did our hands
Unite com- -mu- -tu- -al in most sa- -cred bands
But woe is me you are so sick of late
So far from cheer and from your for- -mer state
That I dis- -trust you Yet though I dis- -trust
Dis- -com- -fort you my lord it noth- -ing must
For wom- -en's fear and love holds quan- -ti- -ty
In nei- -ther aught or in ex- -trem- -i- -ty
Now what my love is proof hath made you know
And as my love is siz'd my fear is so
Where love is great the lit- -tlest doubts are fear
Where lit- -tle fears grow great great love grows there
Faith I must leave thee love and short- -ly too
And thou shalt live in this fair world be- -hind
Such love must needs be trea- -son in my breast
In sec- -ond hus- -band let me be ac- -curst!
Are base re- -spects of thrift but none of love
A sec- -ond time I kill my hus- -band dead
When sec- -ond hus- -band kiss- -es me in bed
I do be- -lieve you think what now you speak
But what we do de- -ter- -mine oft we break
Pur- -pose is but the slave to mem- -o- -ry
Which now like fruit un- -ripe sticks on the tree
But fall un- -shak- -en when they mel- -low be
To pay our- -selves what to our- -selves is debt
What to our- -selves in pas- -sion we pro- -pose
The pas- -sion end- -ing doth the pur- -pose lose
The vi- -o- -lence of ei- -ther grief or joy
Their own en- -ac- -tures with them- -selves de- -stroy
Grief joys joy grieves on slen- -der ac- -ci- -dent
This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our for- -tunes change
For 'tis a ques- -tion left us yet to prove
Whether love lead for- -tune or else for- -tune love
The poor ad- -vanc'd makes friends of en- -e- -mies
And hith- -er- -to doth love on for- -tune tend
For who not needs shall nev- -er lack a friend
And who in want a hol- -low friend doth try
Di- -rect- -ly sea- -sons him his en- -e- -my
But or- -der- -ly to end where I be- -gun
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no sec- -ond hus- -band wed
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
Nor earth to me give food nor heav- -en light!
Sport and re- -pose lock from me day and night!
To des- -per- -a- -tion turn my trust and hope!
Each op- -po- -site that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it de- -stroy!
Both here and hence pur- -sue me last- -ing strife
If once a wid- -ow ev- -er I be wife!
And nev- -er come mis- -chance be- -tween us twain!
Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agree- -ing
With Hecate's ban thrice blast- -ed thrice in- -fect- -ed
On whole- -some life usurp im- -me- -di- -ate- -ly
Ah ha! ome some mu- -sic! Come the recorder- -s!
For if the king like not the com- -e- -dy
Good my lord vouch- -safe me a word with you
By the mass and 'tis like a camel in- -deed
top of my ben- -t. will come by and by
When church- -yards yawn and hell it- -self breathes out
And do such bit- -ter busi- -ness as the day
The soul of Nero en- -ter this firm bo- -som
Let me be cru- -el not un- -nat- -u- -ral
I will speak dag- -gers to her but use none
I like him not nor stands it safe with us
I your com- -mis- -sion will forth- -with dis- -patch
The terms of our es- -tate may not en- -dure
The sin- -gle and pe- -cu- -liar life is bound
With all the strength and ar- -mour of the mind
To keep it- -self from 'noy- -ance but much more
What's near it with it it is a massy wheel
Fix'd on the sum- -mit of the high- -est mount
To whose huge spokes ten thou- -sand less- -er things
Are mor- -tis'd and ad- -join'd which when it falls
Each small an- -nex- -ment pet- -ty con- -se- -quence
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voy- -age
For we will fet- -ters put up- -on this fear
Be- -hind the ar- -ras I'll con- -vey my- -self
And as you said and wise- -ly was it said
Since na- -ture makes them par- -tial should o'er- -hear
The speech of van- -tage Fare you well my liege
I'll call up- -on you ere you go to bed
It hath the pri- -mal el- -dest curse up- -on't
Though in- -cli- -na- -tion be as sharp as will
And like a man to dou- -ble busi- -ness bound
I stand in pause where I shall first be- -gin
Were thick- -er than it- -self with broth- -er's blood
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heav- -ens
But to con- -front the vis- -age of of- -fence?
Or par- -don'd be- -ing down? Then I'll look up
My fault is past But O what form of prayer
That can- -not be since I am still pos- -sess'd
My crown mine own am- -bi- -tion and my queen
In the cor- -rupt- -ed cur- -rents of this world
Of- -fence's gild- -ed hand may shove by jus- -tice
There is no shuf- -fling; here the ac- -tion lies
Even to the teeth and fore- -head of our faults
Try what re- -pen- -tance can what can it not?
O wretch- -ed state! O bo- -som black as death!
Bow stub- -born knees and heart with strings of steel
A vil- -lain kills my fa- -ther and for that
I his sole son do this same vil- -lain send
He took my fa- -ther gross- -ly full of bread
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
But in our cir- -cum- -stance and course of thought
'Tis heavy with him and am I then re- -veng'd
To take him in the purg- -ing of his soul
Up sword and know thou a more hor- -rid hent
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell where- -to it goes My moth- -er stays
My words fly up my thoughts re- -main be- -low
Words with- -out thoughts nev- -er to heav- -en go
He will come straight Look you lay home to him
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood be- -tween
Much heat and him I'll si- -lence me e'en here
Fear me not: ith- -draw I hear him com- -ing
You are the Queen your hus- -band's broth- -er's wife
Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak
Come come and sit you down you shall not budge
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the in- -most part of you
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not mur- -der me?
Leave wring- -ing of your hands peace! sit you down
And let me wring your heart for so I shall
If it be made of pen- -e- -tra- -ble stuff
What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
And sets a blis- -ter there makes mar- -riage- -vows
As false as dicer- -s' oaths O such a deed
A rhap- -sody of words heav- -en's face doth glow
Yea this so- -lid- -i- -ty and com- -pound mass
Look here up- -on this pic- -ture and on this
See what a grace was seat- -ed on this brow
An eye like Mars to threat- -en and com- -mand
New light- -ed on a heav- -en- -kiss- -ing hill
A com- -bi- -na- -tion and a form in- -deed
Where ev- -ery god did seem to set his seal
To give the world as- -sur- -ance of a man
Could you on this fair moun- -tain leave to feed
You can- -not call it love for at your age
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have
But it re- -serv'd some quan- -ti- -ty of choice
That thus hath coz- -en'd you at hood- -man- -blind?
Eyes with- -out feel- -ing feel- -ing with- -out sight
Or but a sick- -ly part of one true sense
O shame! where is thy blush? Re- -bel- -lious hell
If thou canst mu- -tine in a ma- -tron's bones
And melt in her own fire pro- -claim no shame
When the com- -pul- -sive ar- -dour gives the charge
Since frost it- -self as ac- -tive- -ly doth burn
These words like dag- -gers en- -ter in mine ears
A cut- -purse of the em- -pire and the rule
Save me and hov- -er o'er me with your wings
O step be- -tween her and her fight- -ing soul
Con- -ceit in weak- -est bod- -ies strong- -est works
That you do bend your eye on va- -can- -cy
Forth at your eyes your spir- -its wild- -ly peep
And as the sleep- -ing sol- -diers in the alarm
Your bed- -ded hairs like life in ex- -cre- -ments
Start up and stand an end O gen- -tle son
Sprin- -kle cool pa- -tience! Where- -on do you look?
On him on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause con- -join'd preach- -ing to stones
My stern ef- -fects then what I have to do
Noth- -ing at all yet all that is I see
That I have ut- -ter'd bring me to the test
Would gam- -bol from Moth- -er for love of grace
That not your tres- -pass but my mad- -ness speaks
Whilst rank cor- -rup- -tion min- -ing all with- -in
And do not spread the com- -post on the weeds
To make them ranker For- -give me this my virtue
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
O Ham- -let thou hast cleft my heart in twain
And live the pur- -er with the oth- -er half
Good night but go not to mine un- -cle's bed
That mon- -ster cus- -tom who all sense doth eat
That to the use of ac- -tions fair and good
That apt- -ly is put on Re- -frain to- -night
And that shall lend a kind of eas- -i- -ness
To the next ab- -sti- -nence the next more easy
With won- -drous po- -ten- -cy Once more good- -night
I'll bless- -ing beg of you. or this same lord
To pun- -ish me with this and this with me
That I must be their scourge and min- -is- -ter
I will be- -stow him and will an- -swer well
I must be cru- -el on- -ly to be kind
Thus bad be- -gins and worse re- -mains be- -hind
Not this by no means that I bid you do
Pinch wan- -ton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kiss- -es
Make you to rav- -el all this mat- -ter out
But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know
Would from a pad- -dock from a bat a gib
Such dear con- -cern- -ings hide? who would do so?
No in de- -spite of sense and se- -cre- -cy
Un- -peg the bas- -ket on the house- -'s top
Let the birds fly and like the fa- -mous ape
To try con- -clu- -sions in the bas- -ket creep
Be thou as- -sur'd if words be made of breath
And breath of life I have no life to breathe
I had for- -got 'tis so con- -clud- -ed on
They bear the man- -date they must sweep my way
And mar- -shal me to knav- -ery Let it work
For 'tis the sport to have the en- -gin- -er
Hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard be- -low their mines
And blow them at the moon O 'tis most sweet
When in one line two crafts di- -rect- -ly meet
I'll lug the guts in- -to the neigh- -bour room
Is now most still most se- -cret and most grave
Who was in life a fool- -ish peat- -ing knave
Come sir to draw to- -ward an end with you
There's mat- -ter in these sighs These pro- -found heaves
Be- -stow this place on us a lit- -tle while
Ah my good lord what have I seen to- -night!
Mad as the sea and wind when both con- -tend
Be- -hind the ar- -ras hear- -ing some- -thing stir
Whips out his rapi- -er cries 'A rat a rat!'
And in this brain- -ish ap- -pre- -hen- -sion kills
It had been so with us had we been there
His lib- -er- -ty is full of threats to all
To you your- -self to us to ev- -ery one
It will be laid to us whose prov- -i- -dence
Should have kept short re- -strain'd and out of haunt
This mad young man But so much was our love
We would not un- -der- -stand what was most fit
But like the own- -er of a foul dis- -ease
Even on the pith of life Where is he gone?
Shows it- -self pure he weeps for what is done
The sun no soon- -er shall the moun- -tains touch
But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
Both coun- -te- -nance and ex- -cuse. o Guilden- -stern!
Friends both go join you with some fur- -ther aid
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
In- -to the chapel I pray you haste in this
And let them know both what we mean to do
Whose whis- -per o'er the world's di- -am- -e- -ter
As lev- -el as the can- -non to his blank
Trans- -ports his poi- -son'd shot, ay miss our name
My soul is full of dis- -cord and dis- -may
What have you done my lord with the dead body?
Com- -pound- -ed it with dust where- -to 'tis kin
Tell us where 'tis that we may take it thence
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
He's lov'd of the dis- -tract- -ed mul- -ti- -tude
Who like not in their judg- -ment but their eyes
By des- -per- -ate ap- -pli- -ance are re- -liev'd
Which we do ten- -der as we dear- -ly grieve
For that which thou hast done, ust send thee hence
With fiery quick- -ness there- -fore pre- -pare thy- -self
So is it if thou knew'st our pur- -pos- -es
Fol- -low him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
De- -lay it not I'll have him hence to- -night
And Eng- -land if my love thou hold'st at aught
Since yet thy ci- -ca- -trice looks raw and red
Af- -ter the Dan- -ish sword and thy free awe
Pays homage to us, hou mayst not cold- -ly set
Our sov- -er- -eign process which im- -ports at full
By let- -ters con- -jur- -ing to that ef- -fect
The present death of Ham- -let Do it Eng- -land
For like the hec- -tic in my blood he rages
And thou must cure me till I know 'tis done
Go Cap- -tain from me greet the Dan- -ish king
Tell him that by his li- -cense Fort- -in- -bras
We shall ex- -press our du- -ty in his eye
Tru- -ly to speak and with no ad- -di- -tion
We go to gain a lit- -tle patch of ground
That hath in it no prof- -it but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
Nor will it yield to Nor- -way or the Pole
Two thou- -sand souls and twen- -ty thou- -sand ducats
Will not de- -bate the ques- -tion of this straw
This is the im- -posthume of much wealth and peace
That in- -ward breaks and shows no cause with- -out
How all oc- -ca- -sions do in- -form against me
And spur my dull re- -venge! What is a man
If his chief good and mar- -ket of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large dis- -course
Look- -ing be- -fore and af- -ter gave us not
To fust in us un- -us'd Now whether it be
Of think- -ing too pre- -cise- -ly on the event
And ev- -er three parts cow- -ard, do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
Led by a del- -i- -cate and ten- -der prince
Whose spir- -it with di- -vine am- -bi- -tion puff'd
Ex- -pos- -ing what is mor- -tal and un- -sure
To all that for- -tune death and dan- -ger dare
Even for an egg- -shell Right- -ly to be great
Is not to stir with- -out great ar- -gu- -ment
But great- -ly to find quar- -rel in a straw
When hon- -our's at the stake How stand I then
Ex- -cite- -ments of my rea- -son and my blood
And let all sleep? while to my shame I see
That for a fan- -ta- -sy and trick of fame
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
Where- -on the num- -bers can- -not try the cause
She is im- -por- -tu- -nate in- -deed dis- -tract
She speaks much of her fa- -ther says she hears
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
In- -deed would make one think there might be thought
Though noth- -ing sure yet much un- -hap- -pi- -ly
To my sick soul as sin's true na- -ture is
It spills it- -self in fear- -ing to be spilt
When sor- -rows come they come not sin- -gle spies
Last and as much con- -tain- -ing as all these
Her broth- -er is in se- -cret come from France
Feeds on his won- -der keeps him- -self in clouds
With pesti- -lent speech- -es of his fa- -ther's death
Will noth- -ing stick our per- -son to ar- -raign
Like to a mur- -der- -ing piece in many places
Where are my Switzer- -s? let them guard the door
Eats not the flats with more im- -petu- -ous haste
And as the world were now but to be- -gin
An- -tiq- -ui- -ty for- -got cus- -tom not known
The rat- -i- -fiers and props of ev- -ery word
Caps hands and tongues ap- -plaud it to the clouds
How cheer- -ful- -ly on the false trail they cry!
Where is this king? irs stand you all with- -out
Let him go Gertrude do not fear our per- -son
There's such di- -vin- -i- -ty doth hedge a king
That trea- -son can but peep to what it would
How came he dead? I'll not be jug- -gled with
Con- -science and grace to the pro- -found- -est pit!
That both the worlds I give to neg- -li- -gence
Let come what comes on- -ly I'll be re- -veng'd
And for my means I'll hus- -band them so well
If you de- -sire to know the cer- -tain- -ty
That sweep- -stake you will draw both friend and foe
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
Like a good child and a true gen- -tle- -man
That I am guilt- -less of your fa- -ther's death
And am most sen- -si- -bly in grief for it
It shall as lev- -el to your judg- -ment pierce
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May!
Should be as mor- -tal as an old man's life?
Na- -ture is fine in love and where 'tis fine
It sends some pre- -cious in- -stance of it- -self
Hadst thou thy wits and didst per- -suade re- -venge
There's rose- -mary that's for re- -mem- -brance pray love
Thought and af- -flic- -tion pas- -sion hell it- -self
Make choice of whom your wis- -est friends you will
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me
They find us touch'd we will our king- -dom give
Our crown our life and all that we call ours
To you in sat- -is- -fac- -tion but if not
No tro- -phy sword nor hatch- -ment o'er his bones
Sailors sir they say they have let- -ters for you
I do not know from what part of the world
Now must your con- -science my ac- -quit- -tance seal
And you must put me in your heart for friend
Sith you have heard and with a know- -ing ear
That he which hath your no- -ble fa- -ther slain
As by your safe- -ty wis- -dom all things else
Which may to you per- -haps seem much un- -sinew'd
Lives al- -most by his looks and for my- -self
My virtue or my plague be it ei- -ther which
She's so con- -junc- -tive to my life and soul
That as the star moves not but in his sphere
Why to a pub- -lic count I might not go
Would like the spring that tur- -neth wood to stone
Too slight- -ly tim- -ber'd for so loud a wind
And so have I a no- -ble fa- -ther lost
Break not your sleeps for that: ou must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
I lov'd your fa- -ther and we love our- -self
And that I hope will teach you to imag- -ine
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
As how should it be so? how oth- -er- -wise?
So you will not o'er- -rule me to a peace
To thine own peace If he be now re- -turn'd
No more to un- -der- -take it, will work him
Un- -der the which he shall not choose but fall
You have been talk'd of since your trav- -el much
Where- -in they say you shine your sum of parts
As did that one and that in my re- -gard
Yet need- -ful too for youth no less be- -comes
The light and care- -less liv- -ery that it wears
Im- -port- -ing health and grave- -ness. wo months since
And to such won- -drous do- -ing brought his horse
I know him well he is the brooch in- -deed
And gave you such a mas- -ter- -ly re- -port
For art and ex- -er- -cise in your de- -fence
And for your rapi- -er most es- -pe- -cial- -ly
He swore had nei- -ther mo- -tion guard nor eye
That he could noth- -ing do but wish and beg
Your sud- -den com- -ing o'er to play with him
But that I know love is be- -gun by time
Time qual- -i- -fies the spark and fire of it
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
And noth- -ing is at a like good- -ness still
Dies in his own too much that we would do
We should do when we would for this 'would' changes
As there are tongues are hands are ac- -ci- -dents
And then this 'should' is like a spend- -thrift sigh
Ham- -let comes back what would you un- -der- -take
To show your- -self your fa- -ther's son in deed
Ham- -let re- -turn'd shall know you are come home
We'll put on those shall praise your ex- -cel- -lence
And set a dou- -ble var- -nish on the fame
Will not pe- -ruse the foils so that with ease
Or with a lit- -tle shuf- -fling you may choose
I bought an unc- -tion of a moun- -te- -bank
So mor- -tal that but dip a knife in it
Where it draws blood no cat- -a- -plasm so rare
Col- -lect- -ed from all sim- -ples that have virtue
Un- -der the moon can save the thing from death
This is but scratch'd with- -al I'll touch my point
Weigh what con- -ve- -nience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape if this should fail
'Twere bet- -ter not as- -say'd there- -fore this project
Should have a back or sec- -ond that might hold
If this did blast in proof Soft! let me see
We'll make a solemn wa- -ger on your cun- -nings
When in your mo- -tion you are hot and dry
And that he calls for drink I'll have prepar'd him
If he by chance es- -cape your ven- -om'd stuck
One woe doth tread up- -on an- -oth- -er's heel
So fast they fol- -low: our sis- -ter's drown'd Laertes
There with fan- -tas- -tic gar- -lands did she come
Of crowflow- -ers net- -tles daisies and long pur- -ples
There on the pen- -dant boughs her coro- -net weeds
Fell in the weep- -ing brook Her clothes spread wide
Which time she chaunt- -ed snatch- -es of old tunes
As one in- -ca- -pable of her own dis- -tress
Or like a crea- -ture na- -tive and in- -du'd
Too much of wa- -ter hast thou poor Ophe- -lia
And there- -fore I for- -bid my tears but yet
It is our trick na- -ture her cus- -tom holds
Let shame say what it will when these are gone
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Is not parch- -ment made of sheep- -- -skin- -s?
will speak to this fel- -low. hose grave's this sir?
I do not lie in- -'t yet it is mine
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
The queen the courtiers who is that they fol- -low?
And with such maimed rites? This doth be- -to- -ken
Her ob- -se- -quies have been as far en- -larg'd
As we have war- -ranties her death was doubt- -ful
She should in ground un- -sanc- -ti- -fied have lodg'd
Shards flints and peb- -bles should be thrown on her
Yet here she is al- -lowed her vir- -gin rites
Her maid- -en strew- -ments and the bring- -ing home
We should pro- -fane the ser- -vice of the dead
To sing a re- -quiem and such rest to her
And from her fair and un- -pol- -lut- -ed flesh
May vi- -o- -lets spring! tell thee churl- -ish priest
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Ham- -let's wife
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Now pile your dust up- -on the quick and dead
Till of this flat a moun- -tain you have made
Yet have I in me some- -thing dan- -ger- -ous
Why I will fight with him up- -on this theme
Could not with all their quan- -ti- -ty of love
Make up my sum. hat wilt thou do for her?
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thy- -self?
To out- -face me with leap- -ing in her grave?
And if thou prate of moun- -tains let them throw
Make Os- -sa like a wart! Nay an thou'lt mouth
And thus a while the fit will work on him
When that her gold- -en cou- -plets are dis- -clos'd
What is the rea- -son that you use me thus?
The cat will mew and dog will have his day
Strength- -en your pa- -tience in our last night's speech
This grave shall have a liv- -ing mon- -u- -ment
An hour of qui- -et short- -ly shall we see
Till then in pa- -tience our pro- -ceed- -ing be
You do re- -mem- -ber all the cir- -cum- -stance?
And prais'd be rash- -ness for it, et us know
Our in- -dis- -cre- -tion some- -time serves us well
There's a di- -vin- -i- -ty that shapes our ends
Grop'd I to find out them had my de- -sire
Fin- -ger'd their pack- -et and in fine with- -drew
My fears for- -get- -ting man- -ners to un- -seal
O roy- -al knav- -ery! an ex- -act com- -mand
Im- -port- -ing Den- -mark's health and Eng- -land's too
With ho! such bugs and gob- -lins in my life
That on the su- -per- -vise no leisure bat- -ed
No not to stay the grind- -ing of the axe
Here's the com- -mis- -sion read it at more leisure
But wilt thou bear me how I did pro- -ceed?
Be- -ing thus benet- -ted round with vil- -la- -nies
Or I could make a pro- -logue to my brains
De- -vis'd a new com- -mis- -sion wrote it fair
How to for- -get that learn- -ing but sir now
It did me yeo- -man's ser- -vice Wilt thou know
As Eng- -land was his faith- -ful trib- -u- -tary
As peace should still her wheat- -en gar- -land wear
That on the view and know of these con- -tents
With- -out de- -bate- -ment fur- -ther more or less
He should the bear- -ers put to sud- -den death
Why even in that was heav- -en or- -di- -nant
Which was the mod- -el of that Dan- -ish seal
They are not near my con- -science their de- -feat
Does by their own in- -sin- -u- -a- -tion grow
'Tis dan- -ger- -ous when the baser na- -ture comes
Does it not thinks't thee stand me now up- -on
Thrown out his an- -gle for my prop- -er life
What is the is- -sue of the busi- -ness there
It will be short the in- -ter- -im is mine
For by the im- -age of my cause I see
The por- -trai- -ture of his I'll court his favours
say spa- -cious in the pos- -ses- -sion of dirt
bon- -net to his right use 'tis for the head
him by them in his meed he's un- -fel- -lowed
if your lord- -ship would vouch- -safe the an- -swer
I com- -mend my du- -ty to your lord- -ship
them to their tri- -al the bub- -bles are out
The King and Queen and all are com- -ing down
re- -pair hith- -er and say you are not fit
Come Ham- -let come and take this hand from me
But par- -don't as you are a gen- -tle- -man
This pres- -ence knows and you must needs have heard
How I am pun- -ish'd with sore dis- -trac- -tion
Rough- -ly awake I here pro- -claim was mad- -ness
Who does it then? His mad- -ness if't be so
Ham- -let is of the fac- -tion that is wrong'd
His mad- -ness is poor Ham- -let's en- -e- -my
Let my dis- -claim- -ing from a pur- -pos'd evil
That I have shot my ar- -row o'er the house
Whose mo- -tive in this case should stir me most
I stand aloof and will no rec- -on- -cile- -ment
To keep my name un- -gor'd But till that time
I'll be your foil Laertes in mine ig- -no- -rance
Give them the foils young Os- -ric Cousin Ham- -let
I do not fear it I have seen you both
But since he's bet- -ter'd we have there- -fore odds
This is too heavy let me see an- -oth- -er
This likes me well These foils have all a length?
If Ham- -let give the first or sec- -ond hit
Or quit in an- -swer of the third ex- -change
Let all the bat- -tle- -ments their ord- -nance fire
The king shall drink to Ham- -let's bet- -ter breath
Rich- -er than that which four suc- -ces- -sive kings
In Den- -mark's crown have worn Give me the cups
And let the ket- -tle to the trum- -pet speak
'Now the king drinks to Ham- -let.' ome be- -gin
Stay give me drink. am- -let this pearl is thine
Here Ham- -let take my nap- -kin rub thy brows
The queen carous- -es to thy for- -tune Ham- -let
I will my lord I pray you par- -don me
I dare not drink yet madam by- -and- -- -by
I pray you pass with your best vi- -o- -lence
I am afeard you make a wan- -ton of me
They bleed on both sides. ow is it my lord?
No no! the drink the drink! my dear Ham- -let!
O vil- -lany! o! let the door be lock- -'d
It is here Ham- -let Ham- -let thou art slain
In thee there is not half an hour of life
Hath turn'd it- -self on me lo here I lie
Nev- -er to rise again thy moth- -er's poi- -son'd
I can no more: he king the king's to blame
It is a poi- -son tem- -per'd by him- -self
I am dead Ho- -r- -a- -tio. retched queen adieu!
You that look pale and trem- -ble at this chance
Is strict in his ar- -rest, I could tell you
If thou didst ev- -er hold me in thy heart
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
Young Fort- -in- -bras with con- -quest come from Poland
On Fort- -in- -bras he has my dy- -ing voice
Which have so- -licit- -ed. he rest is si- -lence
Now cracks a no- -ble heart. ood night sweet prince
And flights of an- -gels sing thee to thy rest!
If aught of woe or won- -der cease your search
What feast is to- -ward in thine eter- -nal cell
And our af- -fairs from Eng- -land come too late
He nev- -er gave com- -mand- -ment for their death
But since so jump up- -on this bloody ques- -tion
Of car- -nal bloody and un- -nat- -u- -ral acts
And in this up- -shot pur- -pos- -es mis- -took
And call the no- -blest to the au- -di- -ence
Of that I shall have al- -so cause to speak
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
But let this same be present- -ly per- -for- -m'd
Even while men's minds are wild lest more mis- -chance
Bear Ham- -let like a sol- -dier to the stage
For he was like- -ly had he been put on
Take up the bod- -ies. uch a sight as this
