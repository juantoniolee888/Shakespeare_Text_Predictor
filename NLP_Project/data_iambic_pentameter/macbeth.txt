Hov- -er through the fog and filthy air Exe- -unt
Say to the King the knowl- -edge of the broil
The mul- -ti- -ply- -ing vil- -lainies of na- -ture
Do swarm up- -on him from the West- -ern Isles
Of kerns and gal- -low- -glass- -es is sup- -plied
And For- -tune on his damned quar- -rel smil- -ing
For brave Mac- -beth well he de- -serves that name
Dis- -dain- -ing For- -tune with his bran- -dish'd steel
Like Val- -or's min- -ion carved out his pas- -sage
And fix'd his head up- -on our bat- -tle- -ments
Ship- -wreck- -ing storms and dire- -ful thun- -ders break
So from that spring whence com- -fort seem'd to come
Dis- -com- -fort swells Mark King of Scot- -land mark
But the Nor- -weyan lord sur- -vey- -ing van- -tage
With fur- -bish'd arms and new sup- -plies of men
If I say sooth I must re- -port they were
Dou- -bly re- -dou- -bled strokes up- -on the foe
Ex- -cept they meant to bathe in reek- -ing wounds
Or mem- -o- -rize an- -oth- -er Gol- -go- -tha
But I am faint my gash- -es cry for help
So well thy words be- -come thee as thy wounds
Nor- -way him- -self with ter- -ri- -ble num- -bers
As- -sist- -ed by that most dis- -loy- -al traitor
Sweno the Nor- -ways' king craves com- -po- -si- -tion
Nor would we deign him buri- -al of his men
No more that Thane of Caw- -dor shall de- -ceive
And with his for- -mer ti- -tle greet Mac- -beth
What he hath lost no- -ble Mac- -beth hath won
And mounch'd and mounch'd and mounch'd "Give me," quoth I
So foul and fair a day I have not seen
So with- -er'd and so wild in their at- -tire
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
All hail Mac- -beth hail to thee Thane of Glamis!
All hail Mac- -beth that shalt be King here- -after!
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
Are ye fan- -tas- -ti- -cal or that in- -deed
You greet with present grace and great pre- -dic- -tion
Of no- -ble hav- -ing and of roy- -al hope
If you can look in- -to the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not
Speak then to me who nei- -ther beg nor fear
Stay you im- -per- -fect speak- -ers tell me more
By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis
No more than to be Caw- -dor Say from whence
You owe this strange in- -tel- -li- -gence or why
Up- -on this blast- -ed heath you stop our way
With such prophet- -ic greet- -ing? Speak I charge you
The earth hath bub- -bles as the wa- -ter has
As breath in- -to the wind Would they had stay'd!
Or have we eat- -en on the in- -sane root
And Thane of Caw- -dor too Went it not so?
The King hath hap- -pi- -ly re- -ceived Mac- -beth
The news of thy suc- -cess and when he reads
His won- -ders and his prais- -es do con- -tend
Which should be thine or his Si- -lenced with that
Came post with post and ev- -ery one did bear
Thy prais- -es in his king- -dom's great de- -fense
To give thee from our roy- -al mas- -ter thanks
On- -ly to her- -ald thee in- -to his sight
In which ad- -di- -tion hail most wor- -thy Thane
With those of Nor- -way or did line the rebel
He labor'd in his coun- -try's wreck I know not
But trea- -sons cap- -i- -tal con- -fess'd and proved
Be- -sides the Thane of Caw- -dor But 'tis strange
And of- -ten- -times to win us to our harm
The in- -stru- -ments of dark- -ness tell us truths
Win us with hon- -est tri- -fles to be- -tray's
Can- -not be ill can- -not be good If ill
Why hath it giv- -en me earnest of suc- -cess
Whose hor- -rid im- -age doth un- -fix my hair
And make my seat- -ed heart knock at my ribs
Is smoth- -er'd in sur- -mise and noth- -ing is
Like our strange gar- -ments cleave not to their mould
Time and the hour runs through the rough- -est day
Wor- -thy Mac- -beth we stay up- -on your leisure
Give me your fa- -vor my dull brain was wrought
Are reg- -is- -ter'd where ev- -ery day I turn
Think up- -on what hath chanced and at more time
They are not yet come back But I have spoke
With one that saw him die who did re- -port
Im- -plored your High- -ness' par- -don and set forth
A deep re- -pen- -tance Noth- -ing in his life
Be- -came him like the leav- -ing it he died
As one that had been stud- -ied in his death
To find the mind's con- -struc- -tion in the face
He was a gen- -tle- -man on whom I built
En- -ter Mac- -beth Ban- -quo Ross and An- -gus
The sin of my in- -grat- -i- -tude even now
Was heavy on me Thou art so far be- -fore
To over- -take thee Would thou hadst less de- -served
More is thy due than more than all can pay
That hast no less de- -served nor must be known
Wan- -ton in full- -ness seek to hide them- -selves
We will es- -tab- -lish our es- -tate up- -on
Our el- -dest Mal- -colm whom we name here- -after
The Prince of Cum- -ber- -land which hon- -or must
But signs of no- -ble- -ness like stars shall shine
On all de- -servers From hence to In- -ver- -ness
The hear- -ing of my wife with your ap- -proach
On which I must fall down or else o'er- -leap
For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
Let not light see my black and deep de- -sires
The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
True wor- -thy Ban- -quo! He is full so valiant
And in his com- -men- -da- -tions I am fed
To catch the near- -est way Thou wouldst be great
Art not with- -out am- -bi- -tion but with- -out
And yet wouldst wrong- -ly win Thou'ldst have great Glamis
That I may pour my spir- -its in thine ear
And chas- -tise with the val- -or of my tongue
All that im- -pedes thee from the gold- -en round
Which fate and meta- -phys- -i- -cal aid doth seem
Is not thy mas- -ter with him? who were't so
One of my fel- -lows had the speed of him
Who al- -most dead for breath had scarce- -ly more
That croaks the fa- -tal en- -trance of Dun- -can
Un- -der my bat- -tle- -ments Come you spir- -its
That tend on mor- -tal thoughts un- -sex me here
Shake my fell pur- -pose nor keep peace be- -tween
You wait on na- -ture's mis- -chief! Come thick night
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Greater than both by the al- -l- -hail here- -after!
Thy let- -ters have trans- -port- -ed me be- -yond
Your face my Thane is as a book where men
May read strange mat- -ters To be- -guile the time
Look like the time bear wel- -come in your eye
Must be pro- -vid- -ed for and you shall put
This night's great busi- -ness in- -to my dis- -patch
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
To al- -ter fa- -vor ev- -er is to fear
This cas- -tle hath a pleas- -ant seat the air
Nim- -bly and sweet- -ly rec- -om- -mends it- -self
The tem- -ple- -haunt- -ing mart- -let does ap- -prove
But- -tress nor coign of van- -tage but this bird
Where they most breed and haunt I have ob- -served
How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains
Were poor and sin- -gle busi- -ness to con- -tend
And the late dig- -ni- -ties heap'd up to them
To be his pur- -vey- -or but he rides well
Have theirs them- -selves and what is theirs in compt
And shall con- -tin- -ue our graces to- -wards him
If it were done when 'tis done then 'twere well
Could tram- -mel up the con- -se- -quence and catch
Might be the be- -all and the end- -all here
But here up- -on this bank and shoal of time
We still have judge- -ment here that we but teach
Bloody in- -struc- -tions which be- -ing taught re- -turn
To our own lips He's here in dou- -ble trust
Who should against his mur- -ther- -er shut the door
Hath borne his fac- -ul- -ties so meek hath been
So clear in his great of- -fice that his virtues
Will plead like an- -gels trum- -pet- -- -tongued against
Strid- -ing the blast or heav- -en's cheru- -bin horsed
Up- -on the sight- -less couri- -ers of the air
Shall blow the hor- -rid deed in ev- -ery eye
That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
Vault- -ing am- -bi- -tion which o'er- -leaps it- -self
Gold- -en opin- -ions from all sorts of peo- -ple
Which would be worn now in their new- -est gloss
Where- -in you dress'd your- -self? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now to look so green and pale
As thou art in de- -sire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou es- -teem'st the or- -na- -ment of life
And live a cow- -ard in thine own es- -teem
Let- -ting "I dare not" wait up- -on "I would"
I dare do all that may be- -come a man
That made you break this en- -ter- -prise to me?
When you durst do it then you were a man
And to be more than what you were you would
Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
Did then ad- -here and yet you would make both
I would while it was smil- -ing in my face
But screw your courage to the stick- -ing- -- -place
Where- -to the rather shall his day's hard jour- -ney
Sound- -ly in- -vite him his two cham- -ber- -lains
Will I with wine and was- -sail so con- -vince
A lim- -beck on- -ly When in swin- -ish sleep
What can- -not you and I per- -form up- -on
His spongy of- -fi- -cers who shall bear the guilt
For thy un- -daunt- -ed met- -tle should com- -pose
Noth- -ing but males Will it not be re- -ceived
As we shall make our griefs and clam- -or roar
False face must hide what the false heart doth know
The moon is down I have not heard the clock
Hold take my sword There's hus- -bandry in heav- -en
Their can- -dles are all out Take thee that too
A heavy sum- -mons lies like lead up- -on me
Re- -strain in me the cursed thoughts that na- -ture
He hath been in un- -usu- -al plea- -sure and
This di- -a- -mond he greets your wife with- -al
Our will be- -came the ser- -vant to de- -fect
I dreamt last night of the three weird sis- -ters
Yet when we can en- -treat an hour to serve
If you shall cleave to my con- -sent when 'tis
In seek- -ing to aug- -ment it but still keep
My bo- -som fran- -chised and al- -le- -giance clear
Go bid thy mis- -tress when my drink is ready
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fa- -tal vi- -sion sen- -si- -ble
To feel- -ing as to sight? Or art thou but
A dag- -ger of the mind a false cre- -ation
I see thee yet in form as pal- -pa- -ble
And such an in- -stru- -ment I was to use
Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
And on thy blade and dud- -geon gouts of blood
Which was not so be- -fore There's no such thing
Pale Hecate's of- -fer- -ings and with- -er'd Mur- -ther
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
Hear it not Dun- -can for it is a knell
Which gives the stern'st good night He is about it
The doors are open and the sur- -feit- -ed grooms
That death and na- -ture do con- -tend about them
Con- -founds us Hark! I laid their dag- -gers ready
I heard the owl scream and the crick- -ets cry
This is a sor- -ry sight [Looks on his hands
A fool- -ish thought to say a sor- -ry sight
There's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried
But they did say their prayers and ad- -dress'd them
As they had seen me with these hang- -man's hands
But where- -fore could not I pro- -nounce "A- -men"?
I had most need of bless- -ing and "A- -men"
Af- -ter these ways so it will make us mad
Sleep that knits up the rav- -el'd sleave of care
Balm of hurt minds great na- -ture's sec- -ond course
Still it cried "Sleep no more!" to all the house
"Glamis hath mur- -ther'd sleep and there- -fore Caw- -dor
Shall sleep no more Mac- -beth shall sleep no more."
Who was it that thus cried? Why wor- -thy Thane
You do un- -bend your no- -ble strength to think
Why did you bring these dag- -gers from the place?
They must lie there Go car- -ry them and smear
Clean from my hand? No this my hand will rather
The mul- -ti- -tudi- -nous seas in- -car- -na- -dine
My hands are of your col- -or but I shame
A lit- -tle wa- -ter clears us of this deed
And show us to be watch- -ers Be not lost
To know my deed 'twere best not know my- -self
Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
I be- -lieve drink gave thee the lie last night
For 'tis my lim- -it- -ed ser- -vice Ex- -it
Our chim- -neys were blown down and as they say
Lament- -ings heard i' the air strange screams of death
And proph- -esy- -ing with ac- -cents ter- -ri- -ble
Clam- -or'd the live- -long night Some say the earth
My young re- -mem- -brance can- -not par- -al- -lel
O hor- -ror hor- -ror hor- -ror! Tongue nor heart
Con- -fu- -sion now hath made his mas- -ter- -piece
Most sac- -ri- -le- -gious mur- -ther hath broke ope
Ap- -proach the cham- -ber and de- -stroy your sight
With a new Gor- -gon Do not bid me speak
And look on death it- -self! Up up and see
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
That such a hideous trum- -pet calls to par- -ley
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak
The rep- -e- -ti- -tion in a wom- -an's ear
Had I but died an hour be- -fore this chance
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
The spring the head the foun- -tain of your blood
Is stopped the very source of it is stop- -p'd
Those of his cham- -ber as it seem'd had done't
So were their dag- -gers which un- -wiped we found
They stared and were dis- -tract- -ed no man's life
O yet I do re- -pent me of my fury
His sil- -ver skin laced with his gold- -en blood
That had a heart to love and in that heart
That most may claim this ar- -gu- -ment for ours?
Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us?
That suf- -fer in ex- -po- -sure let us meet
In the great hand of God I stand and thence
Exe- -unt all but Mal- -colm and Don- -al- -bain
What will you do? Let's not con- -sort with them
Which the false man does easy I'll to Eng- -land
There's dag- -gers in men's smiles the near in blood
Which steals it- -self when there's no mer- -cy left
Three- -score and ten I can re- -mem- -ber well
Hours dread- -ful and things strange but this sore night
Threat- -en his bloody stage By the clock 'tis day
Is't night's pre- -dom- -i- -nance or the day's shame
That dark- -ness does the face of earth en- -tomb
Even like the deed that's done On Tues- -day last
Beau- -teous and swift the min- -ions of their race
Turn'd wild in na- -ture broke their stalls flung out
They did so to the amaze- -ment of mine eyes
Mal- -colm and Don- -al- -bain the King's two sons
Are stol'n away and fled which puts up- -on them
That would make good of bad and friends of foes!
Thou play'dst most foul- -ly for't yet it was said
It should not stand in thy pos- -ter- -i- -ty
(As up- -on thee Mac- -beth their speech- -es shine)
Why by the ver- -i- -ties on thee made good
May they not be my or- -a- -cles as well
And set me up in hope? But hush no more
as Queen Lennox Ross Lords Ladies and At- -ten- -dants
It had been as a gap in our great feast
Are with a most in- -dis- -sol- -u- -ble tie
We should have else de- -sired your good ad- -vice
Which still hath been both grave and pros- -per- -ous
As far my lord as will fill up the time
When there- -with- -al we shall have cause of state
Crav- -ing us joint- -ly Hie you to horse adieu
Till you re- -turn at night Goes Fleance with you?
I wish your hors- -es swift and sure of foot
And so I do com- -mend you to their backs
Let ev- -ery man be mas- -ter of his time
Till sev- -en at night to make so- -ci- -ety
The sweet- -er wel- -come we will keep our- -self
Sir- -rah a word with you At- -tend those men
Bring them be- -fore us Ex- -it At- -ten- -dant
Reigns that which would be fear'd 'Tis much he dares
And to that daunt- -less tem- -per of his mind
To act in safe- -ty There is none but he
Whose be- -ing I do fear and un- -der him
My ge- -nius is re- -buked as it is said
And bade them speak to him then prophet- -- -like
They hail'd him fa- -ther to a line of kings
Up- -on my head they placed a fruit- -less crown
And put a bar- -ren scep- -tre in my gripe
Thence to be wrench'd with an un- -lin- -eal hand
No son of mine suc- -ceed- -ing If't be so
For Ban- -quo's is- -sue have I filed my mind
Put ran- -cors in the ves- -sel of my peace
On- -ly for them and mine eter- -nal jew- -el
To make them kings the seed of Ban- -quo kings!
Have you con- -sid- -er'd of my speech- -es? Know
So un- -der for- -tune which you thought had been
Who wrought with them and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a no- -tion crazed
I did so and went fur- -ther which is now
Our point of sec- -ond meet- -ing Do you find
That you can let this go? Are you so gospel'd
Ay in the cat- -a- -logue ye go for men
Shoughs wa- -ter- -rugs and demi- -- -wolves are clept
All by the name of dogs The val- -ued file
Hath in him closed where- -by he does re- -ceive
Par- -tic- -u- -lar ad- -di- -tion from the bill
Now if you have a sta- -tion in the file
Not i' the worst rank of man- -hood say it
Grap- -ples you to the heart and love of us
Who wear our health but sick- -ly in his life
Whom the vile blows and buf- -fets of the world
Have so in- -censed that I am reck- -less what
So is he mine and in such bloody dis- -tance
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
For cer- -tain friends that are both his and mine
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
Who I my- -self struck down And thence it is
That I to your as- -sis- -tance do make love
Mask- -ing the busi- -ness from the com- -mon eye
I will ad- -vise you where to plant your- -selves
That I re- -quire a clear- -ness) and with him
To leave no rubs nor botch- -es in the work
Than is his fa- -ther's must em- -brace the fate
It is con- -clud- -ed Ban- -quo thy soul's flight
Say to the King I would at- -tend his leisure
Where our de- -sire is got with- -out con- -tent
Than by de- -struc- -tion dwell in doubt- -ful joy
Us- -ing those thoughts which should in- -deed have died
Should be with- -out re- -gard What's done is done
Re- -mains in dan- -ger of her for- -mer tooth
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
Than on the tor- -ture of the mind to lie
Mal- -ice do- -mes- -tic for- -eign levy noth- -ing
So shall I love and so I pray be you
Let your re- -mem- -brance ap- -ply to Ban- -quo
Present him em- -i- -nence both with eye and tongue
Then be thou jo- -cund Ere the bat hath flown
His clois- -ter'd flight ere to black Hecate's sum- -mons
Hath rung night's yawn- -ing peal there shall be done
Till thou ap- -plaud the deed Come seel- -ing night
Scarf up the ten- -der eye of piti- -ful day
And with thy bloody and in- -vis- -i- -ble hand
Which keeps me pale! Light thick- -ens and the crow
Good things of day be- -gin to droop and drowse
Thou mar- -vel'st at my words but hold thee still
Things bad be- -gun make strong them- -selves by ill
The west yet glim- -mers with some streaks of day
Al- -most a mile but he does usu- -al- -ly
So all men do from hence to the palace gate
Thou mayst re- -venge O slave! Dies Fleance es- -capes
You know your own de- -grees sit down At first
Our host- -ess keeps her state but in best time
Pro- -nounce it for me sir to all our friends
See they en- -counter thee with their heart- -s' thanks
Both sides are even here I'll sit i' the midst
Be large in mirth anon we'll drink a mea- -sure
'Tis bet- -ter thee with- -out than he with- -in
That did the like for Fleance If thou didst it
Whole as the mar- -ble found- -ed as the rock
Ay my good lord Safe in a ditch he bides
There the grown ser- -pent lies the worm that's fled
Hath na- -ture that in time will ven- -om breed
You do not give the cheer The feast is sold
That is not of- -ten vouch'd while 'tis amak- -ing
Here had we now our coun- -try's hon- -or roof'd
Were the graced per- -son of our Ban- -quo present
Who may I rather chal- -lenge for un- -kind- -ness
To grace us with your roy- -al com- -pa- -ny?
Thou canst not say I did it nev- -er shake
Sit wor- -thy friends my lord is of- -ten thus
And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat
The fit is mo- -men- -tary up- -on a thought
He will again be well If much you note him
Feed and re- -gard him not- -Are you a man?
Ay and a bold one that dare look on that
Led you to Dun- -can O these flaws and starts
Im- -pos- -tors to true fear would well be- -come
A wom- -an's sto- -ry at a win- -ter's fire
Why do you make such faces? When al- -l's done
Prithee see there! Be- -hold! Look! Lo! How say you?
Why what care I? If thou canst nod speak too
If char- -nel hous- -es and our graves must send
That when the brains were out the man would die
With twen- -ty mor- -tal mur- -thers on their crowns
And push us from our stools This is more strange
Do not muse at me my most wor- -thy friends
Then I'll sit down Give me some wine fill full
And to our dear friend Ban- -quo whom we miss
Would he were here! To all and him we thirst
Avaunt and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are mar- -row- -less thy blood is cold
Thou hast no spec- -u- -la- -tion in those eyes
On- -ly it spoils the plea- -sure of the time
If trem- -bling I in- -hab- -it then protest me
Even to the dis- -po- -si- -tion that I owe
When now I think you can be- -hold such sights
I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
Au- -gures and un- -der- -stood re- -la- -tions have
By mag- -got pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The se- -cret'st man of blood What is the night?
Al- -most at odds with morn- -ing which is which
I hear it by the way but I will send
There's not a one of them but in his house
And be- -times I will to the weird sis- -ters
By the worst means the worst For mine own good
All caus- -es shall give way I am in blood
Re- -turn- -ing were as te- -dious as go o'er
Strange things I have in head that will to hand
You lack the sea- -son of all na- -tures sleep
Come we'll to sleep My strange and self- -- -abuse
Is the ini- -ti- -ate fear that wants hard use
Have I not rea- -son bel- -dams as you are
Spite- -ful and wrath- -ful who as oth- -ers do
Un- -to a dis- -mal and a fa- -tal end
My for- -mer speech- -es have but hit your thoughts
Was pitied of Mac- -beth mar- -ry he was dead
Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kil- -l'd
It was for Mal- -colm and for Don- -al- -bain
To kill their gra- -cious fa- -ther? Damned fac- -t!
How it did grieve Mac- -beth! Did he not straight
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay and wise- -ly too
He has borne all things well and I do think
That had he Dun- -can's sons un- -der his key
What 'twere to kill a fa- -ther so should Fleance
But peace! For from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
His pres- -ence at the tyran- -t's feast I hear
Mac- -duff lives in dis- -grace Sir can you tell
Lives in the Eng- -lish court and is re- -ceived
Of the most pi- -ous Ed- -ward with such grace
That the malev- -o- -lence of for- -tune noth- -ing
Takes from his high re- -spect Thith- -er Mac- -duff
To wake Northum- -ber- -land and war- -like Si- -ward
Give to our ta- -bles meat sleep to our nights
Do faith- -ful homage and re- -ceive free hon- -ors
All which we pine for now And this re- -port
Hath so ex- -as- -per- -ate the King that he
His wis- -dom can pro- -vide Some holy an- -gel
Fly to the court of Eng- -land and un- -fold
For the in- -gre- -di- -ents of our caw- -dron
En- -ter Hecate to the oth- -er three Witch- -es
How now you se- -cret black and mid- -night hags?
I con- -jure you by that which you pro- -fess
Though you un- -tie the winds and let them fight
Con- -found and swal- -low nav- -i- -ga- -tion up
Though blad- -ed corn be lodged and trees blown down
Though cas- -tles top- -ple on their warder- -s' heads
Even till de- -struc- -tion sick- -en an- -swer me
Mac- -beth! Mac- -beth! Mac- -beth! Be- -ware Mac- -duff
Be- -ware the Thane of Fife Dis- -miss me Enough
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright But one word more
Thun- -der Sec- -ond Ap- -pari- -tion a bloody Child
Then live Mac- -duff What need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make as- -sur- -ance dou- -ble sure
And take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
That ris- -es like the is- -sue of a king
And wears up- -on his ba- -by brow the round
Be li- -on- -met- -tled proud and take no care
Who chafes who frets or where con- -spir- -ers are
Mac- -beth shall nev- -er van- -quish'd be un- -til
Great Bir- -nam Wood to high Dun- -si- -nane Hill
Who can im- -press the for- -est bid the tree
Re- -bel- -lion's head rise nev- -er till the Wood
Shall live the lease of na- -ture pay his breath
To time and mor- -tal cus- -tom Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
I will be sat- -is- -fied! De- -ny me this
Why sinks that caul- -dron and what noise is this?
Thy crown does sear mine eye- -balls And thy hair
Thou oth- -er gold- -bound brow is like the first
And yet the eighth ap- -pears who bears a glass
That twofold balls and tre- -ble scep- -tres car- -ry
And points at them for his What is this so?
In- -fect- -ed be the 'air where- -on they ride
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The gal- -lop- -ing of horse Who wast came by?
'Tis two or three my lord that bring you word
The cas- -tle of Mac- -duff I will sur- -prise
This deed I'll do be- -fore this pur- -pose cool
What had he done to make him fly the land?
Wis- -dom? To leave his wife to leave his babes
His man- -sion and his ti- -tles in a place
From whence him- -self does fly? He loves us not
All is the fear and noth- -ing is the love
As lit- -tle is the wis- -dom where the flight
But cru- -el are the times when we are traitors
From what we fear yet know not what we fear
Each way and move I take my leave of you
To what they were be- -fore My pret- -ty cousin
Fa- -ther'd he is and yet he's fa- -ther- -less
I am so much a fool should I stay longer
And what will you do now? How will you live?
With what I get I mean and so do they
Poor bird! Thou'ldst nev- -er fear the net nor lime
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Now God help thee poor mon- -key! But how wilt
Bless you fair dame! I am not to you known
If you will take a home- -ly man's ad- -vice
Be not found here hence with your lit- -tle ones
To do worse to you were fell cru- -el- -ty
Is of- -ten laud- -able to do good some- -time
Do I put up that wom- -an- -ly de- -fense
I hope in no place so un- -sanc- -ti- -fied
Ex- -it La- -dy Mac- -duff cry- -ing "Mur- -ther!"
Hold fast the mor- -tal sword and like good men
Strike heav- -en on the face that it re- -sounds
What know be- -lieve and what I can re- -dress
As I shall find the time to friend I will
What you have spoke it may be so per- -chance
Was once thought hon- -est You have loved him well
That which you are my thoughts can- -not trans- -pose
An- -gels are bright still though the bright- -est fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
Per- -chance even there where I did find my doubts
Why in that raw- -ness left you wife and child
Those pre- -cious mo- -tives those strong knots of love
Let not my jeal- -ousies be your dis- -hon- -ors
But mine own safeties You may be right- -ly just
The ti- -tle is af- -feer'd Fare thee well lord
I would not be the vil- -lain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyran- -t's grasp
I think our coun- -try sinks be- -neath the yoke
It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
There would be hands up- -lift- -ed in my right
When I shall tread up- -on the tyran- -t's head
More suf- -fer and more sundry ways than ev- -er
It is my- -self I mean in whom I know
Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
Es- -teem him as a lamb be- -ing com- -pared
Lux- -u- -ri- -ous avari- -cious false de- -ceit- -ful
That has a name But there's no bot- -tom none
In my volup- -tuous- -ness Your wives your daugh- -ters
Your ma- -trons and your maids could not fill up
The ces- -tern of my lust and my de- -sire
That did op- -pose my will Bet- -ter Mac- -beth
In na- -ture is a tyran- -ny it hath been
To take up- -on you what is yours You may
We have will- -ing dames enough there can- -not be
That vul- -ture in you to de- -vour so many
As will to great- -ness ded- -i- -cate them- -selves
I should cut off the no- -bles for their lands
De- -sire his jew- -els and this oth- -er's house
And my more- -hav- -ing would be as a sauce
Quar- -rels un- -just against the good and loy- -al
Sticks deep- -er grows with more per- -ni- -cious root
Than sum- -mer- -seem- -ing lust and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear
Scot- -land hath foi- -sons to fill up your will
Of your mere own All these are por- -ta- -ble
But I have none The king- -be- -com- -ing graces
Pour the sweet milk of con- -cord in- -to hell
If such a one be fit to gov- -ern speak
No not to live O na- -tion mis- -er- -able!
With an un- -ti- -tled tyrant blood- -y- -s- -cepter'd
By his own in- -ter- -dic- -tion stands ac- -cursed
Have ban- -ish'd me from Scot- -land O my breast
Wiped the black scru- -ples rec- -on- -ciled my thoughts
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
From over- -- -cred- -u- -lous haste But God above
I put my- -self to thy di- -rec- -tion and
Un- -speak mine own de- -trac- -tion here ab- -jure
The taints and blames I laid up- -on my- -self
Un- -known to wom- -an nev- -er was for- -sworn
Scarce- -ly have cov- -et- -ed what was mine own
At no time broke my faith would not be- -tray
The dev- -il to his fel- -low and de- -light
Is thine and my poor coun- -try's to com- -mand
Whith- -er in- -deed be- -fore thy here- -ap- -proach
Old Si- -ward with ten thou- -sand war- -like men
Such wel- -come and un- -wel- -come things at once
Well more anon Comes the King forth I pray you?
Ay sir there are a crew of wretch- -ed souls
That stay his cure Their mal- -a- -dy con- -vinces
The great as- -say of art but at his touch
A most mirac- -u- -lous work in this good King
To the suc- -ceed- -ing roy- -al- -ty he leaves
The heal- -ing bene- -dic- -tion With this strange virtue
He hath a heav- -en- -ly gift of prophe- -cy
My coun- -try- -man but yet I know him not
My ev- -er gen- -tle cousin wel- -come hith- -er
I know him now Good God be- -times re- -move
Al- -most afraid to know it- -self! It can- -not
But who knows noth- -ing is once seen to smile
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
A mod- -ern ec- -sta- -sy The dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who and good men's lives
Ex- -pire be- -fore the flow- -ers in their caps
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speak- -er
Be not a nig- -gard of your speech How goest?
Which was to my be- -lief wit- -ness'd the rather
For that I saw the tyran- -t's pow- -er afoot
Would cre- -ate sol- -diers make our wom- -en fight
Lent us good Si- -ward and ten thou- -sand men
An old- -er and a bet- -ter sol- -dier none
This com- -fort with the like! But I have words
But in it shares some woe though the main part
Your cas- -tle is sur- -prised your wife and babes
Were on the quar- -ry of these mur- -ther'd deer
What man! Neer pull your hat up- -on your brows
Give sor- -row words The grief that does not speak
Whis- -pers the o'er- -fraught heart and bids it break
He has no chil- -dren All my pret- -ty ones?
What all my pret- -ty chick- -ens and their dam
But I must al- -so feel it as a man
I can- -not but re- -mem- -ber such things were
And would not take their part? Sin- -ful Mac- -duff
They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am
Not for their own de- -mer- -its but for mine
Be this the whet- -stone of your sword Let grief
O I could play the wom- -an with mine eyes
Cut short all in- -ter- -mis- -sion front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scot- -land and my- -self
Our lack is noth- -ing but our leave Mac- -beth
Is ripe for shak- -ing and the pow- -ers above
Since his Majesty went in- -to the field have seen
You may to me and 'tis most meet you should
En- -ter La- -dy Mac- -beth with a ta- -per
Why it stood by her She has light by her
Out damned spot! Out I say! One two why then
Wash your hands put on your night- -gown look not
To bed to bed there's knock- -ing at the gate
More needs she the di- -vine than the physi- -cian
And still keep eyes up- -on her So good night
My mind she has mat- -ed and amazed my sight
His un- -cle Si- -ward and the good Mac- -duff
Re- -venges burn in them for their dear caus- -es
Of all the gen- -try There is Se- -ward's son
Great Dun- -si- -nane he strong- -ly for- -ti- -fies
He can- -not buck- -le his dis- -tem- -per'd cause
His se- -cret mur- -thers stick- -ing on his hands
Now minute- -ly re- -volts up- -braid his faith- -breach
Those he com- -mands move on- -ly in com- -mand
When all that is with- -in him does con- -demn
To give obe- -di- -ence where 'tis tru- -ly owed
And with him pour we in our coun- -try's purge
Till Bir- -nam Wood re- -move to Dun- -si- -nane
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall nev- -er sag with doubt nor shake with fear
When I be- -hold Sey- -ton I say! This push
Will cheer me ev- -er or dis- -seat me now
And that which should ac- -com- -pa- -ny old age
As hon- -or love obe- -di- -ence troops of friends
I must not look to have but in their stead
Send out more hors- -es skirr the coun- -try round
Raze out the writ- -ten trou- -bles of the brain
And with some sweet obliv- -i- -ous an- -ti- -dote
Cleanse the stuff'd bo- -som of that per- -ilous stuff
Come put mine ar- -mor on give me my staff
Come sir dis- -patch If thou couldst doc- -tor cast
The wa- -ter of my land find her dis- -ease
And purge it to a sound and pris- -tine health
That should ap- -plaud again Pul- -l't off I say
Would scour these Eng- -lish hence? Hearst thou of them?
Ay my good lord your roy- -al prepa- -ra- -tion
Till Bir- -nam For- -est come to Dun- -si- -nane
Let ev- -ery sol- -dier hew him down a bough
Keeps still in Dun- -si- -nane and will en- -dure
That will with due de- -ci- -sion make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe
But cer- -tain is- -sue strokes must ar- -bi- -trate
Hang out our ban- -ners on the out- -ward walls
Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie
Were they not forced with those that should be ours
We might have met them dare- -ful beard to beard
I have al- -most for- -got the taste of fears
The time has been my sens- -es would have cool'd
To hear a night- -shriek and my fell of hair
Would at a dis- -mal trea- -tise rouse and stir
There would have been a time for such a word
Creeps in this pet- -ty pace from day to day
To the last syl- -la- -ble of record- -ed time
And all our yes- -ter- -days have light- -ed fools
The way to dusty death Out out brief can- -dle!
That struts and frets his hour up- -on the stage
And then is heard no more It is a tale
Told by an id- -iot full of sound and fury
I should re- -port that which I say I saw
As I did stand my watch up- -on the hill
Let me en- -dure your wrath if't be not so
I care not if thou dost for me as much
I pull in res- -o- -lu- -tion and be- -gin
To doubt the equiv- -o- -ca- -tion of the fiend
That lies like truth "Fear not till Bir- -nam Wood
Do come to Dun- -si- -nane," and now a wood
Comes to- -ward Dun- -si- -nane Arm arm and out!
Do we but find the tyran- -t's pow- -er tonight
Let us be beat- -en if we can- -not fight
Make all our trum- -pets speak give them all breath
Those clam- -orous har- -bin- -gers of blood and death
That was not born of wom- -an? Such a one
If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine
My wife and chil- -dren's ghosts will haunt me still
I can- -not strike at wretch- -ed kerns whose arms
Or else my sword with an un- -bat- -ter'd edge
I sheathe again un- -deed- -ed There thou shouldst be
By this great clat- -ter one of great- -est note
This way my lord the castle's gen- -tly ren- -der'd
The tyran- -t's peo- -ple on both sides do fight
The no- -ble Thanes do brave- -ly in the war
The day al- -most it- -self pro- -fess- -es yours
Why should I play the Ro- -man fool and die
But get thee back my soul is too much charged
With thy keen sword im- -press as make me bleed
Let fall thy blade on vul- -ner- -a- -ble crests
And let the an- -gel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Mac- -duff was from his moth- -er's womb
For it hath cow'd my bet- -ter part of man!
And be these jug- -gling fiends no more be- -lieved
That pat- -ter with us in a dou- -ble sense
That keep the word of prom- -ise to our ear
We'll have thee as our rar- -er mon- -sters are
Paint- -ed up- -on a pole and un- -der- -writ
To kiss the ground be- -fore young Mal- -colm's feet
And to be bait- -ed with the rab- -ble's curse
Though Bir- -nam Wood be come to Dun- -si- -nane
Yet I will try the last Be- -fore my body
I throw my war- -like shield! Lay on Mac- -duff
I would the friends we miss were safe ar- -rived
Some must go off and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheap- -ly bought
Mac- -duff is miss- -ing and your no- -ble son
Your son my lord has paid a sol- -dier's debt
He on- -ly lived but till he was a man
In the un- -shrink- -ing sta- -tion where he fought
Must not be mea- -sured by his worth for then
I would not wish them to a fair- -er death
They say he part- -ed well and paid his score
Hail King for so thou art Be- -hold where stands
I see thee com- -pass'd with thy king- -dom's pearl
We shall not spend a large ex- -pense of time
In such an hon- -or named What's more to do
Which would be plant- -ed new- -ly with the time
Pro- -duc- -ing forth the cru- -el min- -is- -ters
Took off her life this and what need- -ful else
That calls up- -on us by the grace of Grace
We will per- -form in mea- -sure time and place
So thanks to all at once and to each one
Whom we in- -vite to see us crown'd at Scone
