Who's there?
Nay an- -swer me stand and un- -fold your- -self
Long live the king!
Bernar- -do?
You come most care- -ful- -ly up- -on your hour
'Tis now struck twelve Get thee to bed Fran- -cis- -co
For this re- -lief much thanks 'tis bit- -ter cold
And I am sick at heart
Have you had qui- -et guard?
Not a mouse stir- -ring
Well good night
If you do meet Ho- -r- -a- -tio and Mar- -cel- -lus
The ri- -vals of my watch bid them make haste
I think I hear them. tand ho! Who is there?
Friends to this ground
And liege- -men to the Dane
Give you good- -night
O farewell hon- -est sol- -dier
Who hath re- -liev'd you?
Bernar- -do has my place
Give you good- -night
Hol- -la! Bernar- -do!
What is Ho- -r- -a- -tio there?
A piece of him
Wel- -come Ho- -r- -a- -tio: el- -come good Mar- -cel- -lus
What has this thing ap- -pear'd again to- -night?
I have seen noth- -ing
Ho- -r- -a- -tio says 'tis but our fan- -ta- -sy
And will not let be- -lief take hold of him
Touch- -ing this dread- -ed sight twice seen of us
There- -fore I have en- -treat- -ed him along
With us to watch the min- -utes of this night
That if again this ap- -pari- -tion come
He may ap- -prove our eyes and speak to it
Tush tush 'twill not ap- -pear
Sit down awhile
And let us once again as- -sail your ears
That are so for- -ti- -fied against our sto- -ry
What we two nights have seen
Well sit we down
And let us hear Bernar- -do speak of this
Last night of all
When yond same star that's west- -ward from the pole
Had made his course to il- -lume that part of heav- -en
Where now it burns Mar- -cel- -lus and my- -self
The bell then beat- -ing one
Peace break thee off look where it comes again!
In the same fig- -ure like the king that's dead
Thou art a schol- -ar speak to it Ho- -r- -a- -tio
Looks it not like the King? mark it Ho- -r- -a- -tio
Most like: t har- -rows me with fear and won- -der
It would be spoke to
Ques- -tion it Ho- -r- -a- -tio
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
To- -geth- -er with that fair and war- -like form
In which the majesty of buried Den- -mark
Did some- -times march? By heav- -en I charge thee speak!
It is of- -fend- -ed
See it stalks away!
Stay! speak speak! I charge thee speak!
'Tis gone and will not an- -swer
How now Ho- -r- -a- -tio! You trem- -ble and look pale
Is not this some- -thing more than fan- -ta- -sy?
What think you on't?
Be- -fore my God I might not this be- -lieve
With- -out the sen- -si- -ble and true avouch
Of mine own eyes
Is it not like the King?
As thou art to thy- -self
Such was the very ar- -mour he had on
When he the am- -bi- -tious Nor- -way com- -bat- -ed
So frown'd he once when in an an- -gry par- -le
He smote the sled- -ded Po- -lacks on the ice
'Tis strange
Thus twice be- -fore and jump at this dead hour
With mar- -tial stalk hath he gone by our watch
In what par- -tic- -u- -lar thought to work I know not
But in the gross and scope of my opin- -ion
This bodes some strange erup- -tion to our state
Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
Why this same strict and most ob- -ser- -vant watch
So night- -ly toils the sub- -ject of the land
And why such dai- -ly cast of brazen can- -non
And for- -eign mart for im- -ple- -ments of war
Why such im- -press of ship- -wrights whose sore task
Does not di- -vide the Sun- -day from the week
What might be to- -ward that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night join- -t- -labour- -er with the day
Who is't that can in- -form me?
That can I
At least the whis- -per goes so Our last king
Whose im- -age even but now ap- -pear'd to us
Was as you know by Fort- -in- -bras of Nor- -way
There- -to prick- -'d on by a most em- -u- -late pride
Dar'd to the com- -bat in which our valiant Ham- -let
For so this side of our known world es- -teem'd him
Did slay this Fort- -in- -bras who by a seal'd com- -pact
Well rat- -i- -fied by law and her- -aldry
Did for- -feit with his life all those his lands
Which he stood seiz'd of to the con- -queror
Against the which a moi- -ety com- -pe- -tent
Was gaged by our king which had re- -turn'd
To the in- -her- -i- -tance of Fort- -in- -bras
Had he been van- -quish- -er as by the same cov- -'- -nant
And car- -riage of the ar- -ti- -cle de- -sign'd
His fell to Ham- -let Now sir young Fort- -in- -bras
Of unim- -proved met- -tle hot and full
Hath in the skirts of Nor- -way here and there
Shark'd up a list of law- -less res- -o- -lutes
For food and di- -et to some en- -ter- -prise
That hath a stom- -ach in- -'t which is no oth- -er
As it doth well ap- -pear un- -to our state
But to re- -cov- -er of us by strong hand
And terms com- -pul- -sato- -ry those fore- -said lands
So by his fa- -ther lost and this I take it
Is the main mo- -tive of our prepa- -ra- -tions
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post- -haste and ro- -mage in the land
I think it be no oth- -er but e'en so
Well may it sort that this por- -ten- -tous fig- -ure
Comes armed through our watch so like the king
That was and is the ques- -tion of these wars
A mote it is to trou- -ble the mind's eye
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
A lit- -tle ere the might- -i- -est Julius fell
The graves stood ten- -ant- -less and the sheet- -ed dead
Did squeak and gib- -ber in the Ro- -man streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Dis- -as- -ters in the sun and the moist star
Up- -on whose in- -flu- -ence Nep- -tune's em- -pire stands
Was sick al- -most to dooms- -day with eclipse
And even the like pre- -curse of fierce events
As har- -bin- -gers pre- -ced- -ing still the fates
And pro- -logue to the omen com- -ing on
Have heav- -en and earth to- -geth- -er demon- -strat- -ed
Un- -to our cli- -ma- -ture and coun- -try- -men
But soft be- -hold! lo where it comes again!
I'll cross it though it blast me. tay il- -lu- -sion!
If thou hast any sound or use of voice
Speak to me
If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and race to me
Speak to me
If thou art privy to thy coun- -try's fate
Which hap- -pi- -ly fore- -know- -ing may avoid
O speak!
Or if thou hast up- -hoard- -ed in thy life
Ex- -tort- -ed trea- -sure in the womb of earth
For which they say you spir- -its oft walk in death
Speak of it: tay and speak! top it Mar- -cel- -lus!
Shall I strike at it with my par- -ti- -san?
Do if it will not stand
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis gone!
We do it wrong be- -ing so ma- -jes- -ti- -cal
To of- -fer it the show of vi- -o- -lence
For it is as the air in- -vul- -ner- -a- -ble
And our vain blows ma- -li- -cious mock- -ery
It was about to speak when the cock crew
And then it start- -ed like a guilty thing
Up- -on a fear- -ful sum- -mons I have heard
The cock that is the trum- -pet to the morn
Doth with his lofty and shril- -l- -- -sound- -ing throat
Awake the god of day and at his warn- -ing
Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
The ex- -trav- -a- -gant and erring spir- -it hies
To his con- -fine and of the truth here- -in
This present ob- -ject made pro- -ba- -tion
It fad- -ed on the crow- -ing of the cock
Some say that ev- -er 'gainst that sea- -son comes
Where- -in our Saviour's birth is cel- -e- -brat- -ed
The bird of dawn- -ing singeth all night long
And then they say no spir- -it dare stir abroad
The nights are whole- -some then no plan- -ets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath pow- -er to charm
So hal- -low'd and so gra- -cious is the time
So have I heard and do in part be- -lieve it
But look the morn in rus- -set man- -tle clad
Walks o'er the dew of yon high east- -ward hill
Break we our watch up and by my ad- -vice
Let us im- -part what we have seen to- -night
Un- -to young Ham- -let for up- -on my life
This spir- -it dumb to us will speak to him
Do you con- -sent we shall ac- -quaint him with it
As need- -ful in our loves fit- -ting our du- -ty?
Let's do't I pray and I this morn- -ing know
Where we shall find him most con- -ve- -nient- -ly
Though yet of Ham- -let our dear broth- -er's death
The mem- -o- -ry be green and that it us be- -fit- -ted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole king- -dom
To be con- -tract- -ed in one brow of woe
Yet so far hath dis- -cre- -tion fought with na- -ture
That we with wis- -est sor- -row think on him
To- -geth- -er with re- -mem- -brance of our- -selves
There- -fore our some- -time sis- -ter now our queen
Th' im- -pe- -ri- -al join- -tress to this war- -like state
Have we as 'twere with a de- -feat- -ed joy
With an aus- -pi- -cious and one drop- -ping eye
With mirth in fu- -ner- -al and with dirge in mar- -riage
In equal scale weigh- -ing de- -light and dole
Tak- -en to wife nor have we here- -in bar- -r'd
Your bet- -ter wis- -doms which have freely gone
With this af- -fair along: r all our thanks
Now fol- -lows that you know young Fort- -in- -bras
Hold- -ing a weak sup- -pos- -al of our worth
Or think- -ing by our late dear broth- -er's death
Our state to be dis- -joint and out of frame
Col- -leagued with this dream of his ad- -van- -tage
He hath not fail'd to pester us with mes- -sage
Im- -port- -ing the sur- -ren- -der of those lands
Lost by his fa- -ther with all bonds of law
To our most valiant broth- -er So much for him
Now for our- -self and for this time of meet- -ing
Thus much the busi- -ness is: e have here writ
To Nor- -way un- -cle of young Fort- -in- -bras
Who im- -po- -tent and bed- -rid scarce- -ly hears
Of this his nephew's pur- -pose, o sup- -press
His fur- -ther gait here- -in in that the levies
The lists and full pro- -por- -tions are all made
Out of his sub- -jec- -t: nd we here dis- -patch
You good Cor- -nelius and you Volti- -mand
For bear- -ers of this greet- -ing to old Nor- -way
Giv- -ing to you no fur- -ther per- -son- -al pow- -er
To busi- -ness with the king more than the scope
Of these di- -lat- -ed ar- -ti- -cles al- -low
Farewell and let your haste com- -mend your du- -ty
Cor and Volt
In that and all things will we show our du- -ty
We doubt it noth- -ing hearti- -ly farewell
And now Laertes what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit what is't Laertes?
You can- -not speak of rea- -son to the Dane
And lose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertes
That shall not be my of- -fer not thy ask- -ing?
The head is not more na- -tive to the heart
The hand more in- -stru- -men- -tal to the mouth
Than is the throne of Den- -mark to thy fa- -ther
What wouldst thou have Laertes?
Dread my lord
Your leave and favour to re- -turn to France
From whence though will- -ing- -ly I came to Den- -mark
To show my du- -ty in your coro- -na- -tion
Yet now I must con- -fess that du- -ty done
My thoughts and wish- -es bend again to- -ward France
And bow them to your gra- -cious leave and par- -don
Have you your fa- -ther's leave? What says Polo- -nius?
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
By labour- -some pe- -ti- -tion and at last
Up- -on his will I seal'd my hard con- -sent
I do be- -seech you give him leave to go
Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now my cousin Ham- -let and my son
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so my lord I am too much i' the sun
Good Ham- -let cast thy night- -ed colour off
And let thine eye look like a friend on Den- -mark
Do not for ev- -er with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy no- -ble fa- -ther in the dust
Thou know'st 'tis com- -mon, ll that lives must die
Pass- -ing through na- -ture to eter- -ni- -ty
Ay madam it is com- -mon
If it be
Why seems it so par- -tic- -u- -lar with thee?
Seems madam! Nay it is I know not seems
'Tis not alone my inky cloak good moth- -er
Nor cus- -tom- -ary suits of solemn black
Nor windy sus- -pi- -ra- -tion of for- -c'd breath
No nor the fruit- -ful riv- -er in the eye
Nor the de- -ject- -ed 'hav- -ior of the vis- -age
To- -geth- -er with all forms moods shows of grief
That can de- -note me tru- -ly these in- -deed seem
For they are ac- -tions that a man might play
But I have that with- -in which pas- -seth show
These but the trap- -pings and the suits of woe
'Tis sweet and com- -mend- -able in your na- -ture Ham- -let
To give these mourn- -ing du- -ties to your fa- -ther
But you must know your fa- -ther lost a fa- -ther
That fa- -ther lost lost his and the sur- -vivor bound
In fil- -ial obli- -ga- -tion for some term
To do ob- -se- -quious sor- -row but to per- -se- -vere
In ob- -sti- -nate con- -dole- -ment is a course
Of im- -pi- -ous stub- -born- -ness 'tis un- -man- -ly grief
It shows a will most in- -cor- -rect to heav- -en
A heart un- -for- -ti- -fied a mind im- -pa- -tient
An un- -der- -stand- -ing sim- -ple and un- -school'd
For what we know must be and is as com- -mon
As any the most vul- -gar thing to sense
Why should we in our peev- -ish op- -po- -si- -tion
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heav- -en
A fault against the dead a fault to na- -ture
To rea- -son most ab- -surd whose com- -mon theme
Is death of fa- -thers and who still hath cried
From the first corse till he that died to- -- -day
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
This un- -pre- -vail- -ing woe and think of us
As of a fa- -ther for let the world take note
You are the most im- -me- -di- -ate to our throne
And with no less no- -bil- -i- -ty of love
Than that which dear- -est fa- -ther bears his son
Do I im- -part to- -ward you For your in- -tent
In go- -ing back to school in Wit- -ten- -berg
It is most ret- -ro- -grade to our de- -sire
And we be- -seech you bend you to re- -main
Here in the cheer and com- -fort of our eye
Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
Let not thy moth- -er lose her prayers Ham- -let
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wit- -ten- -berg
I shall in all my best obey you madam
Why 'tis a lov- -ing and a fair re- -ply
Be as our- -self in Den- -mark. adam come
This gen- -tle and un- -for- -c'd ac- -cord of Ham- -let
Sits smil- -ing to my heart in grace where- -of
No jo- -cund health that Den- -mark drinks to- -- -day
But the great can- -non to the clouds shall tell
And the king's rouse the heav- -en shall bruit again
Re- -s- -peak- -ing earth- -ly thun- -der Come away
O that this too too sol- -id flesh would melt
Thaw and re- -solve it- -self in- -to a dew!
Or that the Ev- -er- -last- -ing had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self- -- -s- -laugh- -ter! O God! O God!
How weary stale flat and un- -prof- -itable
Seem to me all the us- -es of this world!
Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an un- -weed- -ed gar- -den
That grows to seed things rank and gross in na- -ture
Pos- -sess it mere- -ly That it should come to this!
But two months dead! ay not so much not two
So ex- -cel- -lent a king that was to this
Hy- -pe- -r- -i- -on to a satyr so lov- -ing to my moth- -er
That he might not be- -teem the winds of heav- -en
Vis- -it her face too rough- -ly Heav- -en and earth!
Must I re- -mem- -ber? Why she would hang on him
As if in- -crease of ap- -petite had grown
By what it fed on and yet with- -in a month
Let me not think on't, railty thy name is wom- -an!
A lit- -tle month or ere those shoes were old
With which she fol- -lowed my poor fa- -ther's body
Like Niobe all tears; hy she even she
O God! a beast that wants dis- -course of rea- -son
Would have mourn'd longer, ar- -ried with mine un- -cle
My fa- -ther's broth- -er but no more like my fa- -ther
Than I to Her- -cules with- -in a month
Ere yet the salt of most un- -righ- -teous tears
Had left the flush- -ing in her galled eyes
She mar- -ried O most wicked speed to post
With such dex- -ter- -i- -ty to in- -ces- -tu- -ous sheet- -s!
It is not nor it can- -not come to good
But break my heart, or I must hold my tongue!
Hail to your lord- -ship!
I am glad to see you well
Ho- -r- -a- -tio, r I do for- -get my- -self
The same my lord and your poor ser- -vant ev- -er
Sir my good friend I'll change that name with you
And what make you from Wit- -ten- -berg Ho- -r- -a- -tio?
Mar- -cel- -lus?
My good lord
I am very glad to see you. ood even sir
But what in faith make you from Wit- -ten- -berg?
A tru- -ant dis- -po- -si- -tion good my lord
I would not hear your en- -e- -my say so
Nor shall you do my ear that vi- -o- -lence
To make it truster of your own re- -port
Against your- -self I know you are no tru- -ant
But what is your af- -fair in Elsi- -nore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you de- -part
My lord I came to see your fa- -ther's fu- -ner- -al
I prithee do not mock me fel- -low- -s- -tu- -dent
I think it was to see my moth- -er's wed- -ding
In- -deed my lord it fol- -low'd hard up- -on
Thrift thrift Ho- -r- -a- -tio! The fu- -ner- -al bak'd meats
Did cold- -ly fur- -nish forth the mar- -riage ta- -bles
Would I had met my dear- -est foe in heav- -en
Or ev- -er I had seen that day Ho- -r- -a- -tio!
My fa- -ther, ethinks I see my fa- -ther
Where my lord?
In my mind's eye Ho- -r- -a- -tio
I saw him once he was a good- -ly king
He was a man take him for all in all
I shall not look up- -on his like again
My lord I think I saw him yestern- -ight
Saw who?
My lord the king your fa- -ther
The King my fa- -ther!
Sea- -son your ad- -mi- -ra- -tion for awhile
With an at- -tent ear till I may de- -liv- -er
Up- -on the wit- -ness of these gen- -tle- -men
This mar- -vel to you
For God's love let me hear
Two nights to- -geth- -er had these gen- -tle- -men
Mar- -cel- -lus and Bernar- -do on their watch
In the dead vast and mid- -dle of the night
Been thus en- -coun- -ter'd A fig- -ure like your fa- -ther
Armed at point ex- -act- -ly cap- -a- -pe
Ap- -pears be- -fore them and with solemn march
Goes slow and state- -ly by them thrice he walk'd
By their op- -press'd and fear- -- -sur- -prised eyes
With- -in his trun- -cheon's length whilst they dis- -til- -l'd
Al- -most to jel- -ly with the act of fear
Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
In dread- -ful se- -cre- -cy im- -part they did
And I with them the third night kept the watch
Where as they had de- -liv- -er'd both in time
Form of the thing each word made true and good
The ap- -pari- -tion comes I knew your fa- -ther
These hands are not more like
But where was this?
My lord up- -on the plat- -form where we watch'd
Did you not speak to it?
My lord I did
But an- -swer made it none yet once methought
It lift- -ed up it head and did ad- -dress
It- -self to mo- -tion like as it would speak
But even then the morn- -ing cock crew loud
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And van- -ish'd from our sight
'Tis very strange
As I do live my hon- -our'd lord 'tis true
And we did think it writ down in our du- -ty
To let you know of it
In- -deed in- -deed sirs but this trou- -bles me
Hold you the watch to- -night?
Mar and Ber
We do my lord
Ar- -m'd say you?
Ar- -m'd my lord
From top to toe?
My lord from head to foot
Then saw you not his face?
O yes my lord he wore his beaver up
What look'd he frown- -ing- -ly?
A coun- -te- -nance more in sor- -row than in anger
Pale or red?
Nay very pale
And fix'd his eyes up- -on you?
Most con- -stant- -ly
I would I had been there
It would have much amaz'd you
Very like very like Stay'd it long?
While one with mod- -er- -ate haste might tell a hun- -dred
Mar and Ber
Longer longer
Not when I saw't
His beard was griz- -zled, o?
It was as I have seen it in his life
A sable sil- -ver'd
I will watch to- -night
Per- -chance 'twill walk again
I war- -r'nt it will
If it as- -sume my no- -ble fa- -ther's per- -son
I'll speak to it though hell it- -self should gape
And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
If you have hith- -er- -to con- -ceal'd this sight
Let it be ten- -able in your si- -lence still
And what- -so- -ev- -er else shall hap to- -night
Give it an un- -der- -stand- -ing but no tongue
I will re- -quite your loves So fare ye well
Up- -on the plat- -form 'twixt eleven and twelve
I'll vis- -it you
Our du- -ty to your hon- -our
Your loves as mine to you farewell
My fa- -ther's spir- -it in arm- -s! All is not well
I doubt some foul play would the night were come!
Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
Though all the earth o'er- -whelm them to men's eyes
My nec- -es- -saries are em- -bark'd farewell
And sis- -ter as the winds give ben- -e- -fit
And con- -voy is as- -sis- -tant do not sleep
But let me hear from you
Do you doubt that?
For Ham- -let and the tri- -fling of his favour
Hold it a fash- -ion and a toy in blood
A vi- -o- -let in the youth of primy na- -ture
For- -ward not per- -ma- -nent sweet not last- -ing
The per- -fume and sup- -pli- -ance of a minute
No more
No more but so?
Think it no more
For na- -ture cres- -cent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk but as this tem- -ple wax- -es
The in- -ward ser- -vice of the mind and soul
Grows wide with- -al Per- -haps he loves you now
And now no soil nor cau- -tel doth be- -smirch
The virtue of his will but you must fear
His great- -ness weigh'd his will is not his own
For he him- -self is sub- -ject to his birth
He may not as un- -val- -u'd per- -sons do
Carve for him- -self for on his choice de- -pends
The safe- -ty and health of this whole state
And there- -fore must his choice be cir- -cum- -scrib'd
Un- -to the voice and yield- -ing of that body
Where- -of he is the head Then if he says he loves you
It fits your wis- -dom so far to be- -lieve it
As he in his par- -tic- -u- -lar act and place
May give his say- -ing deed which is no fur- -ther
Than the main voice of Den- -mark goes with- -al
Then weigh what loss your hon- -our may sus- -tain
If with too cre- -dent ear you list his songs
Or lose your heart or your chaste trea- -sure open
To his un- -mas- -ter'd im- -por- -tu- -ni- -ty
Fear it Ophe- -lia fear it my dear sis- -ter
And keep you in the rear of your af- -fec- -tion
Out of the shot and dan- -ger of de- -sire
The chari- -est maid is prodi- -gal enough
If she un- -mask her beau- -ty to the moon
Virtue it- -self scopes not calum- -nious strokes
The canker galls the in- -fants of the spring
Too oft be- -fore their but- -tons be dis- -clos'd
And in the morn and liq- -uid dew of youth
Con- -ta- -gious blast- -ments are most im- -mi- -nent
Be wary then best safe- -ty lies in fear
Youth to it- -self rebels though none else near
I shall th' ef- -fect of this good les- -son keep
As watch- -man to my heart But good my broth- -er
Do not as some un- -gra- -cious pas- -tors do
Show me the steep and thorny way to heav- -en
Whilst like a puff'd and reck- -less lib- -er- -tine
Him- -self the prim- -rose path of dal- -liance treads
And recks not his own read
O fear me not
I stay too long: ut here my fa- -ther comes
A dou- -ble bless- -ing is a dou- -ble grace
Oc- -ca- -sion smiles up- -on a sec- -ond leave
Yet here Laertes! aboard aboard for shame!
The wind sits in the shoul- -der of your sail
And you are stay'd for There, y bless- -ing with thee!
And these few pre- -cepts in thy mem- -o- -ry
Look thou char- -ac- -ter Give thy thoughts no tongue
Nor any un- -pro- -por- -tion'd thought his act
Be thou fa- -mil- -iar but by no means vul- -gar
Those friends thou hast and their adop- -tion tried
Grap- -ple them un- -to thy soul with hoops of steel
But do not dull thy palm with en- -ter- -tain- -ment
Of each new- -hatch'd un- -fledg'd com- -rade Be- -ware
Of en- -trance to a quar- -rel but be- -ing in
Bear't that the op- -posed may be- -ware of thee
Give ev- -ery man thine ear but few thy voice
Take each man's cen- -sure but re- -serve thy judg- -ment
Cost- -ly thy habit as thy purse can buy
But not ex- -press'd in fan- -cy rich not gaudy
For the ap- -par- -el oft pro- -claims the man
And they in France of the best rank and sta- -tion
Are most se- -lect and gen- -er- -ous chief in that
Nei- -ther a bor- -row- -er nor a lender be
For loan oft los- -es both it- -self and friend
And bor- -row- -ing dulls the edge of hus- -bandry
This above al- -l, o thine own self be true
And it must fol- -low as the night the day
Thou canst not then be false to any man
Farewell my bless- -ing sea- -son this in thee!
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
The time in- -vites you go your ser- -vants tend
Farewell Ophe- -lia and re- -mem- -ber well
What I have said to you
'Tis in my mem- -o- -ry lock- -'d
And you your- -self shall keep the key of it
What is't Ophe- -lia he hath said to you?
So please you some- -thing touch- -ing the Lord Ham- -let
Mar- -ry well bethought
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Giv- -en pri- -vate time to you and you your- -self
Have of your au- -di- -ence been most free and boun- -teous
If it be so, s so 'tis put on me
And that in way of cau- -tion, must tell you
You do not un- -der- -stand your- -self so clear- -ly
As it be- -hooves my daugh- -ter and your hon- -our
What is be- -tween you? give me up the truth
He hath my lord of late made many ten- -ders
Of his af- -fec- -tion to me
Af- -fec- -tion! pooh! you speak like a green girl
Un- -sift- -ed in such per- -ilous cir- -cum- -stance
Do you be- -lieve his ten- -ders as you call them?
I do not know my lord what I should think
Mar- -ry I'll teach you think your- -self a ba- -by
That you have ta'en these ten- -ders for true pay
Which are not ster- -ling Ten- -der your- -self more dear- -ly
Or, ot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Wrong- -ing it thus, ou'll ten- -der me a fool
My lord he hath im- -por- -tun'd me with love
In hon- -ourable fash- -ion
Ay fash- -ion you may call it go to go to
And hath giv- -en coun- -te- -nance to his speech my lord
With al- -most all the holy vows of heav- -en
Ay springes to catch wood- -cocks I do know
When the blood burns how prodi- -gal the soul
Lends the tongue vows these blazes daugh- -ter
Giv- -ing more light than heat, xtinct in both
Even in their prom- -ise as it is a- -- -mak- -ing
You must not take for fire From this time
Be some- -thing scant- -er of your maid- -en pres- -ence
Set your en- -treat- -ments at a high- -er rate
Than a com- -mand to par- -ley For Lord Ham- -let
Be- -lieve so much in him that he is young
And with a larg- -er teth- -er may he walk
Than may be giv- -en you in few Ophe- -lia
Do not be- -lieve his vows for they are bro- -kers
Not of that dye which their in- -vest- -ments show
But mere im- -plorators of un- -holy suits
Breath- -ing like sanc- -ti- -fied and pi- -ous bawds
The bet- -ter to be- -guile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
Have you so slan- -der any mo- -ment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Ham- -let
Look to't I charge you come your ways
I shall obey my lord
The air bites shrewd- -ly it is very cold
It is a nip- -ping and an ea- -ger air
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve
No it is struck
In- -deed? I heard it not then draws near the sea- -son
Where- -in the spir- -it held his wont to walk
What does this mean my lord?
The King doth wake to- -night and takes his rouse
Keeps was- -sail and the swag- -ger- -ing up- -- -spring reels
And as he drains his draughts of Rhen- -ish down
The ket- -tle- -- -drum and trum- -pet thus bray out
The tri- -umph of his pledge
Is it a cus- -tom?
Ay mar- -ry is't
But to my mind, hough I am na- -tive here
And to the man- -ner born, t is a cus- -tom
More hon- -our'd in the breach than the ob- -ser- -vance
This heavy- -- -head- -ed rev- -el east and west
Makes us tra- -duc'd and tax'd of oth- -er na- -tions
They clepe us drunk- -ards and with swin- -ish phrase
Soil our ad- -di- -tion and in- -deed it takes
From our achieve- -ments though per- -for- -m'd at height
The pith and mar- -row of our at- -tribute
So oft it chances in par- -tic- -u- -lar men
That for some vi- -cious mole of na- -ture in them
As in their birth, here- -in they are not guilty
Since na- -ture can- -not choose his ori- -gin
By the o'er- -growth of some com- -plex- -ion
Oft break- -ing down the pales and forts of rea- -son
Or by some habit that too much o'er- -leav- -ens
The form of plau- -sive man- -ner- -s; hat these men
Car- -ry- -ing I say the stamp of one de- -fect
Be- -ing na- -ture's liv- -ery or for- -tune's star
Their virtues else, e they as pure as grace
As in- -fi- -nite as man may un- -der- -go
Shall in the gen- -er- -al cen- -sure take cor- -rup- -tion
From that par- -tic- -u- -lar fault the dram of eale
Doth all the no- -ble sub- -stance of- -ten doubt
To his own scan- -dal
Look my lord it comes!
An- -gels and min- -is- -ters of grace de- -fend us!
Be thou a spir- -it of health or gob- -lin damn'd
Bring with thee airs from heav- -en or blasts from hell
Be thy in- -tents wicked or char- -i- -ta- -ble
Thou com'st in such a ques- -tion- -able shape
That I will speak to thee I'll call thee Ham- -let
King fa- -ther roy- -al Dane O an- -swer me!
Let me not burst in ig- -no- -rance but tell
Why thy can- -on- -iz'd bones hearsed in death
Have burst their cere- -ments why the sepul- -chre
Where- -in we saw thee qui- -et- -ly in- -- -urn'd
Hath op'd his pon- -der- -ous and mar- -ble jaws
To cast thee up again! What may this mean
That thou dead corse again in com- -plete steel
Re- -vis- -it'st thus the glimpses of the moon
Mak- -ing night hideous and we fools of na- -ture
So hor- -rid- -ly to shake our dis- -po- -si- -tion
With thoughts be- -yond the reach- -es of our soul- -s?
Say why is this? where- -fore? what should we do?
It beck- -ons you to go away with it
As if it some im- -part- -ment did de- -sire
To you alone
Look with what cour- -te- -ous ac- -tion
It waves you to a more re- -moved ground
But do not go with it!
No by no means
It will not speak then will I fol- -low it
Do not my lord
Why what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee
And for my soul what can it do to that
Be- -ing a thing im- -mor- -tal as it- -self?
It waves me forth again; 'll fol- -low it
What if it tempt you to- -ward the flood my lord
Or to the dread- -ful sum- -mit of the cliff
That bee- -tles o'er his base in- -to the sea
And there as- -sume some oth- -er hor- -ri- -ble form
Which might de- -prive your sovereign- -ty of rea- -son
And draw you in- -to mad- -ness? think of it
The very place puts toys of des- -per- -a- -tion
With- -out more mo- -tive in- -to ev- -ery brain
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
And hears it roar be- -neath
It waves me still
Go on I'll fol- -low thee
You shall not go my lord
Hold off your hands
Be rul'd you shall not go
My fate cries out
And makes each pet- -ty artery in this body
As hardy as the Ne- -mean li- -on's nerve
Still am I cal- -l'd; nhand me gen- -tle- -men
By heav- -en I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say away! o on I'll fol- -low thee
He wax- -es des- -per- -ate with imag- -i- -na- -tion
Let's fol- -low 'tis not fit thus to obey him
Have af- -ter. o what is- -sue will this come?
Some- -thing is rot- -ten in the state of Den- -mark
Heav- -en will di- -rect it
Nay let's fol- -low him
Whith- -er wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no fur- -ther
Mark me
I will
My hour is al- -most come
When I to sulph'u- -ous and tor- -ment- -ing flames
Must ren- -der up my- -self
Alas poor ghost!
Pity me not but lend thy se- -ri- -ous hear- -ing
To what I shall un- -fold
Speak I am bound to hear
So art thou to re- -venge when thou shalt hear
What?
I am thy fa- -ther's spir- -it
Doom'd for a cer- -tain term to walk the night
And for the day con- -fin'd to wastein fires
Till the foul crimes done in my days of na- -ture
Are burnt and purg'd away But that I am for- -bid
To tell the se- -crets of my pris- -on- -- -house
I could a tale un- -fold whose light- -est word
Would har- -row up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
Thy knot- -ted and com- -bined locks to part
And each par- -tic- -u- -lar hair to stand on end
Like quills up- -on the fret- -ful por- -cu- -pine
But this eter- -nal bla- -zon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. ist list O list!
If thou didst ev- -er thy dear fa- -ther love
O God!
Re- -venge his foul and most un- -nat- -u- -ral mur- -der
Mur- -der!
Mur- -der most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and un- -nat- -u- -ral
Haste me to know't that I with wings as swift
As med- -i- -ta- -tion or the thoughts of love
May sweep to my re- -venge
I find thee apt
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That rots it- -self in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Ham- -let hear
'Tis giv- -en out that sleep- -ing in my or- -chard
A ser- -pent stung me so the whole ear of Den- -mark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abus'd but know thou no- -ble youth
The ser- -pent that did sting thy fa- -ther's life
Now wears his crown
O my prophet- -ic soul!
Mine un- -cle!
Ay that in- -ces- -tu- -ous that adul- -ter- -ate beast
With witch- -craft of his wit with trai- -tor- -ous gifts
O wicked wit and gifts that have the pow- -er
So to se- -duce! on to his shame- -ful lust
The will of my most seem- -ing- -vir- -tu- -ous queen
O Ham- -let what a falling- -off was there!
From me whose love was of that dig- -ni- -ty
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in mar- -riage and to de- -cline
Up- -on a wretch whose nat- -u- -ral gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue as it nev- -er will be mov'd
Though lewd- -ness court it in a shape of heav- -en
So lust though to a ra- -di- -ant an- -gel link'd
Will sate it- -self in a ce- -les- -tial bed
And prey on garbage
But soft! me- -thinks I scent the morn- -ing air
Brief let me be. leep- -ing with- -in my or- -chard
My cus- -tom al- -ways of the af- -ter- -noon
Up- -on my se- -cure hour thy un- -cle stole
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
And in the porch- -es of my ears did pour
The lep- -er- -ous dis- -til- -ment whose ef- -fect
Holds such an en- -mi- -ty with blood of man
That swift as quick- -sil- -ver it cour- -ses through
The nat- -u- -ral gates and al- -leys of the body
And with a sud- -den vigour it doth pos- -set
And curd like ea- -ger drop- -pings in- -to milk
The thin and whole- -some blood so did it mine
And a most in- -stant tet- -ter bark'd about
Most lazar- -- -like with vile and loath- -some crust
All my smooth body
Thus was I sleep- -ing by a broth- -er's hand
Of life of crown of queen at once dis- -patch'd
Cut off even in the blos- -soms of my sin
Un- -hous'led dis- -ap- -point- -ed unanel'd
No reck- -on- -ing made but sent to my ac- -count
With all my im- -per- -fec- -tions on my head
O hor- -ri- -ble! O hor- -ri- -ble! most hor- -ri- -ble!
If thou hast na- -ture in thee bear it not
Let not the roy- -al bed of Den- -mark be
A couch for lux- -u- -ry and damned in- -cest
But how- -so- -ev- -er thou pur- -su'st this act
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul con- -trive
Against thy moth- -er aught leave her to heav- -en
And to those thorns that in her bo- -som lodge
To prick and sting her Fare thee well at on- -ce!
The glow- -worm shows the matin to be near
And 'gins to pale his un- -ef- -fec- -tu- -al fire
Adieu adieu! Ham- -let re- -mem- -ber me
O all you host of heav- -en! O earth! what else?
And shall I cou- -ple hel- -l? O fie! old my heart
And you my sinews grow not in- -stant old
But bear me stiffly up. emem- -ber thee!
Ay thou poor ghost while mem- -o- -ry holds a seat
In this dis- -tract- -ed globe Re- -mem- -ber thee!
Yea from the ta- -ble of my mem- -o- -ry
I'll wipe away all triv- -ial fond records
All saws of books all forms all pres- -sures past
That youth and ob- -ser- -va- -tion copied there
And thy com- -mand- -ment all alone shall live
With- -in the book and vol- -ume of my brain
Un- -mix'd with baser mat- -ter yes by heav- -en!
O most per- -ni- -cious wom- -an!
O vil- -lain vil- -lain smil- -ing damned vil- -lain!
My ta- -bles, eet it is I set it down
That one may smile and smile and be a vil- -lain
At least I am sure it may be so in Den- -mark
So un- -cle there you are Now to my word
It is 'Adieu adieu! re- -mem- -ber me:'
I have sworn't
So be it!
Hil- -lo ho ho boy! Come bird come
How is't my no- -ble lord?
What news my lord?
O won- -der- -ful!
Good my lord tell it
No you'll re- -veal it
Not I my lord by heav- -en
Nor I my lord
How say you then would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be se- -cret?
Hor and Mar
Ay by heav- -en my lord
There's ne'er a vil- -lain dwelling in all Den- -mark
But he's an ar- -rant knave
There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
To tell us this
Why right you are i' the right
And so with- -out more cir- -cum- -stance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
You as your busi- -ness and de- -sires shall point you
For ev- -ery man hath busi- -ness and de- -sire
Such as it is; nd for my own poor part
Look you I'll go pray
These are but wild and whirling words my lord
I'm sor- -ry they of- -fend you hearti- -ly
Yes faith hearti- -ly
There's no of- -fence my lord
Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Ho- -r- -a- -tio
And much of- -fence too Touch- -ing this vi- -sion here
It is an hon- -est ghost that let me tell you
For your de- -sire to know what is be- -tween us
O'er- -mas- -ter't as you may And now good friends
As you are friends schol- -ars and sol- -diers
Give me one poor re- -quest
What is't my lord? we will
Nev- -er make known what you have seen to- -night
Hor and Mar
My lord we will not
Nay but swear't
In faith
My lord not I
Nor I my lord in faith
Up- -on my sword
We have sworn my lord al- -ready
In- -deed up- -on my sword in- -deed
Ha ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there truepen- -ny?
Come on! ou hear this fel- -low in the cel- -larage
Con- -sent to swear
Pro- -pose the oath my lord
Nev- -er to speak of this that you have seen
Swear by my sword
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground
Come hith- -er gen- -tle- -men
And lay your hands again up- -on my sword
Nev- -er to speak of this that you have heard
Swear by my sword
Well said old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A wor- -thy pi- -o- -ner! nce more re- -move good friends
O day and night but this is won- -drous strange!
And there- -fore as a stranger give it wel- -come
There are more things in heav- -en and earth Ho- -r- -a- -tio
Than are dreamt of in your phi- -los- -o- -phy
But come
Here as be- -fore nev- -er so help you mer- -cy
How strange or odd soe'er I bear my- -self
As I per- -chance here- -after shall think meet
To put an an- -tic dis- -po- -si- -tion on
That you at such times see- -ing me nev- -er shall
With arms en- -cum- -ber'd thus or this head- -- -shake
Or by pro- -nounc- -ing of some doubt- -ful phrase
As 'Well well we know' or 'We could an if we would'
Or 'If we list to speak' or 'There be an if they might'
Or such am- -bigu- -ous giv- -ing out to note
That you know aught of me: his is not to do
So grace and mer- -cy at your most need help you
Rest rest per- -turbed spir- -it! o gen- -tle- -men
With all my love I do com- -mend me to you
And what so poor a man as Ham- -let is
May do to ex- -press his love and friend- -ing to you
God will- -ing shall not lack Let us go in to- -geth- -er
And still your fin- -gers on your lips I pray
The time is out of join- -t: cursed spite
That ev- -er I was born to set it right!
Nay come let's go to- -geth- -er
Act II
Give him this mon- -ey and these notes Rey- -nal- -do
I will my lord
You shall do mar- -vel- -lous wise- -ly good Rey- -nal- -do
Be- -fore You vis- -it him to make in- -quiry
Of his be- -hav- -iour
My lord I did in- -tend it
Mar- -ry well said very well said Look you sir
En- -quire me first what Danskers are in Paris
And how and who what means and where they keep
What com- -pa- -ny at what ex- -pense and find- -ing
By this en- -com- -pass- -ment and drift of ques- -tion
That they do know my son come you more near- -er
Than your par- -tic- -u- -lar de- -mands will touch it
Take you as 'twere some dis- -tant knowl- -edge of him
As thus 'I know his fa- -ther and his friends
And in part him; o you mark this Rey- -nal- -do?
Ay very well my lord
'And in part him; ut,' you may say 'not well
But if't be he I mean he's very wild
Ad- -dict- -ed so and so;' and there put on him
What forg- -eries you please mar- -ry none so rank
As may dis- -hon- -our him take heed of that
But sir such wan- -ton wild and usu- -al slips
As are com- -pan- -ions not- -ed and most known
To youth and lib- -er- -ty
As gam- -ing my lord
Ay or drink- -ing fenc- -ing swear- -ing quar- -relling
Drab- -bing: ou may go so far
My lord that would dis- -hon- -our him
Faith no as you may sea- -son it in the charge
You must not put an- -oth- -er scan- -dal on him
That he is open to in- -con- -ti- -nen- -cy
That's not my mean- -ing but breathe his faults so quaint- -ly
That they may seem the taints of lib- -er- -ty
The flash and out- -break of a fiery mind
A sav- -age- -ness in un- -re- -claimed blood
Of gen- -er- -al as- -sault
But my good lord
Where- -fore should you do this?
Ay my lord
I would know that
Mar- -ry sir here's my drift
And I be- -lieve it is a fetch of war- -rant
You lay- -ing these slight sul- -lies on my son
As 'twere a thing a lit- -tle soil'd i' the work- -ing
Mark you
Your par- -ty in con- -verse him you would sound
Hav- -ing ev- -er seen in the prenom- -i- -nate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty be as- -sur'd
He clos- -es with you in this con- -se- -quence
'Good sir,' or so or 'friend,' or 'gentle- -man'
Ac- -cord- -ing to the phrase or the ad- -di- -tion
Of man and coun- -try
Very good my lord
And then sir does he this, e does hat was I about to say?
By the mass I was about to say some- -thing: here did I leave?
At 'clos- -es in the con- -se- -quence,' at 'friend or so,' and
gen- -tle- -man.'
At los- -es in the con- -se- -quence' y mar- -ry!
He clos- -es with you thus: I know the gen- -tle- -man
I saw him yes- -ter- -day or t'other day
Or then or then with such or such and as you say
There was he gam- -ing there o'er- -took in- -'s rouse
There fall- -ing out at ten- -nis' or per- -chance
'I saw him en- -ter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet a broth- -el, r so forth
See you now
Your bait of false- -hood takes this carp of truth
And thus do we of wis- -dom and of reach
With wind- -laces and with as- -says of bias
By in- -di- -rec- -tions find di- -rec- -tions out
So by my for- -mer lec- -ture and ad- -vice
Shall you my son You have me have you not?
My lord I have
God b' wi' you fare you well
Good my lord!
Ob- -serve his in- -cli- -na- -tion in your- -self
I shall my lord
And let him ply his mu- -sic
Well my lord
Farewell!
How now Ophe- -li- -a! what's the mat- -ter?
Alas my lord I have been so af- -fright- -ed!
With what i' the name of God?
My lord as I was sewing in my cham- -ber
Lord Ham- -let, ith his dou- -blet all un- -brac'd
No hat up- -on his head his stock- -ings foul'd
Un- -gart'red and down- -- -gyved to his an- -kle
Pale as his shirt his knees knock- -ing each oth- -er
And with a look so piteous in pur- -port
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of hor- -rors, e comes be- -fore me
Mad for thy love?
My lord I do not know
But tru- -ly I do fear it
What said he?
He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Then goes he to the length of all his arm
And with his oth- -er hand thus o'er his brow
He falls to such pe- -rusal of my face
As he would draw it Long stay'd he so
At last, lit- -tle shak- -ing of mine arm
And thrice his head thus wav- -ing up and down
He rais'd a sigh so piteous and pro- -found
As it did seem to shat- -ter all his bulk
And end his be- -ing that done he lets me go
And with his head over his shoul- -der turn'd
He seem'd to find his way with- -out his eyes
For out o' doors he went with- -out their help
And to the last bend- -ed their light on me
Come go with me I will go seek the king
This is the very ec- -sta- -sy of love
Whose vi- -o- -lent prop- -er- -ty for- -does it- -self
And leads the will to des- -per- -ate un- -der- -tak- -ings
As oft as any pas- -sion un- -der heav- -en
That does af- -flict our na- -tures I am sor- -ry
What have you giv- -en him any hard words of late?
No my good lord but as you did com- -mand
I did re- -pel his let- -ters and de- -nied
His ac- -cess to me
That hath made him mad
I am sor- -ry that with bet- -ter heed and judg- -ment
I had not quot- -ed him I fear'd he did but tri- -fle
And meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jeal- -ousy!
It seems it as prop- -er to our age
To cast be- -yond our- -selves in our opin- -ions
As it is com- -mon for the younger sort
To lack dis- -cre- -tion Come go we to the king
This must be known which be- -ing kept close might move
More grief to hide than hate to ut- -ter love
Wel- -come dear Rosen- -crantz and Guilden- -stern!
More- -over that we much did long to see you
The need we have to use you did pro- -voke
Our hasty send- -ing Some- -thing have you heard
Of Ham- -let's trans- -for- -ma- -tion so I call it
Since nor the ex- -te- -ri- -or nor the in- -ward man
Re- -sem- -bles that it was What it should be
More than his fa- -ther's death that thus hath put him
So much from the un- -der- -stand- -ing of him- -self
I can- -not dream of I en- -treat you both
That be- -ing of so young days brought up with him
And since so neigh- -bour'd to his youth and hu- -mour
That you vouch- -safe your rest here in our court
Some lit- -tle time so by your com- -pa- -nies
To draw him on to plea- -sures and to gath- -er
So much as from oc- -ca- -sion you may glean
Whether aught to us un- -known af- -flicts him thus
That open'd lies with- -in our rem- -e- -dy
Good gen- -tle- -men he hath much talk'd of you
And sure I am two men there are not liv- -ing
To whom he more ad- -heres If it will please you
To show us so much gen- -try and good- -will
As to ex- -pend your time with us awhile
For the sup- -ply and prof- -it of our hope
Your vis- -i- -ta- -tion shall re- -ceive such thanks
As fits a king's re- -mem- -brance
Both your majesties
Might by the sov- -er- -eign pow- -er you have of us
Put your dread plea- -sures more in- -to com- -mand
Than to en- -treaty
We both obey
And here give up our- -selves in the full bent
To lay our ser- -vice freely at your feet
To be com- -mand- -ed
Thanks Rosen- -crantz and gen- -tle Guilden- -stern
Thanks Guilden- -stern and gen- -tle Rosen- -crantz
And I be- -seech you in- -stant- -ly to vis- -it
My too- -- -much- -changed son. o some of you
And bring these gen- -tle- -men where Ham- -let is
Heav- -ens make our pres- -ence and our prac- -tices
Pleas- -ant and help- -ful to him!
Ay amen!
Th' am- -bas- -sadors from Nor- -way my good lord
Are joy- -ful- -ly re- -turn'd
Thou still hast been the fa- -ther of good news
Have I my lord? As- -sure you my good liege
I hold my du- -ty as I hold my soul
Both to my God and to my gra- -cious king
And I do think, r else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of pol- -i- -cy so sure
As it hath us'd to do, hat I have found
The very cause of Ham- -let's lu- -na- -cy
O speak of that that do I long to hear
Give first ad- -mit- -tance to the am- -bas- -sadors
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
Thy- -self do grace to them and bring them in
He tells me my sweet queen he hath found
The head and source of all your son's dis- -tem- -per
I doubt it is no oth- -er but the main
His fa- -ther's death and our o'er- -hasty mar- -riage
Well we shall sift him
Wel- -come my good friend- -s!
Say Volti- -mand what from our broth- -er Nor- -way?
Most fair re- -turn of greet- -ings and de- -sires
Up- -on our first he sent out to sup- -press
His nephew's levies which to him ap- -pear'd
To be a prepa- -ra- -tion 'gainst the Po- -lack
But bet- -ter look'd in- -to he tru- -ly found
It was against your high- -ness where- -at griev'd
That so his sick- -ness age and im- -po- -tence
Was false- -ly borne in hand, ends out ar- -rests
On Fort- -in- -bras which he in brief obeys
Re- -ceives re- -buke from Nor- -way and in fine
Makes vow be- -fore his un- -cle nev- -er more
To give th' as- -say of arms against your majesty
Where- -on old Nor- -way over- -come with joy
Gives him three thou- -sand crowns in an- -nu- -al fee
And his com- -mis- -sion to em- -ploy those sol- -diers
So levied as be- -fore against the Po- -lack
With an en- -treaty here- -in fur- -ther shown
That it might please you to give qui- -et pass
Through your do- -min- -ions for this en- -ter- -prise
On such re- -gards of safe- -ty and al- -lowance
As there- -in are set down
It likes us well
And at our more con- -sid- -er'd time we'll read
An- -swer and think up- -on this busi- -ness
Mean- -time we thank you for your well- -- -took labour
Go to your rest at night we'll feast to- -geth- -er
Most wel- -come home!
This busi- -ness is well end- -ed
My liege and madam, o ex- -pos- -tu- -late
What majesty should be what du- -ty is
Why day is day night is night and time is time
Were noth- -ing but to waste night day and time
There- -fore since brevi- -ty is the soul of wit
And te- -dious- -ness the limbs and out- -ward flour- -ish- -es
I will be brief: our no- -ble son is mad
Mad call I it for to de- -fine true mad- -ness
What is't but to be noth- -ing else but mad?
But let that go
More mat- -ter with less art
Madam I swear I use no art at all
That he is mad 'tis true 'tis true 'tis pity
And pity 'tis 'tis true a fool- -ish fig- -ure
But farewell it for I will use no art
Mad let us grant him then and now re- -mains
That we find out the cause of this ef- -fect
Or rather say the cause of this de- -fect
For this ef- -fect de- -fec- -tive comes by cause
Thus it re- -mains and the re- -main- -der thus
I have a daugh- -ter, ave whilst she is mine
Who in her du- -ty and obe- -di- -ence mark
Hath giv- -en me this now gath- -er and sur- -mise
'To the ce- -les- -tial and my soul's idol the most beau- -ti- -fied
Ophe- -li- -a,'
That's an ill phrase a vile phrase 'beau- -ti- -fied' is a vile
phrase but you shall hear Thus
'In her ex- -cel- -lent white bo- -som these &c.'
Came this from Ham- -let to her?
Good madam stay awhile I will be faith- -ful
'Doubt thou the stars are fire
Doubt that the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar
But nev- -er doubt I love
'O dear Ophe- -lia I am ill at these num- -bers I have not art to
reck- -on my groans but that I love thee best O most best be- -lieve
it Adieu
'Thine ev- -er- -more most dear la- -dy whilst this ma- -chine is to him

This in obe- -di- -ence hath my daugh- -ter show'd me
And more above hath his so- -lic- -it- -ings
As they fell out by time by means and place
All giv- -en to mine ear
But how hath she
Re- -ceiv'd his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faith- -ful and hon- -ourable
I would fain prove so But what might you think
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
As I per- -ceiv'd it I must tell you that
Be- -fore my daugh- -ter told me what might you
Or my dear majesty your queen here think
If I had play'd the desk or table- -- -book
Or giv- -en my heart a wink- -ing mute and dumb
Or look'd up- -on this love with idle sight
What might you think? No I went round to work
And my young mis- -tress thus I did be- -speak
'Lord Ham- -let is a prince out of thy sphere
This must not be:' and then I pre- -cepts gave her
That she should lock her- -self from his re- -sort
Ad- -mit no mes- -sen- -gers re- -ceive no to- -kens
Which done she took the fruits of my ad- -vice
And he re- -pulsed, short tale to make
Fell in- -to a sad- -ness then in- -to a fast
Thence to a watch thence in- -to a weak- -ness
Thence to a light- -ness and by this de- -clen- -sion
In- -to the mad- -ness where- -in now he raves
And all we wail for
Do you think 'tis this?
It may be very like- -ly
Hath there been such a time, 'd fain know that
That I have pos- -i- -tive- -ly said ''Tis so,'
When it prov'd oth- -er- -wise?
Not that I know
Take this from this if this be oth- -er- -wise
If cir- -cum- -stances lead me I will find
Where truth is hid though it were hid in- -deed
With- -in the cen- -tre
How may we try it fur- -ther?
You know some- -times he walks for hours to- -geth- -er
Here in the lob- -by
So he does in- -deed
At such a time I'll loose my daugh- -ter to him
Be you and I be- -hind an ar- -ras then
Mark the en- -counter if he love her not
And he not from his rea- -son fal- -l'n there- -on
Let me be no as- -sis- -tant for a state
But keep a farm and carters
We will try it
But look where sad- -ly the poor wretch comes read- -ing
Away I do be- -seech you both away
I'll board him present- -ly: give me leave
How does my good Lord Ham- -let?
Well God- -a- -mer- -cy
Do you know me my lord?
Ex- -cel- -lent well you're a fish- -mon- -ger
Not I my lord
Then I would you were so hon- -est a man
Hon- -est my lord!
Ay sir to be hon- -est as this world goes is to be one man
picked out of ten thou- -sand
That's very true my lord
For if the sun breed mag- -gots in a dead dog be- -ing a god- -kiss- -ing
car- -rion, ave you a daugh- -ter?
I have my lord
Let her not walk i' the sun con- -cep- -tion is a bless- -ing but not
as your daugh- -ter may con- -ceive: riend look to't
How say you by that? Aside.] Still harp- -ing on my daugh- -ter: et
he knew me not at first he said I was a fish- -mon- -ger he is far
gone far gone and tru- -ly in my youth I suf- -fered much ex- -trem- -i- -ty
for love very near this I'll speak to him again. hat do you
read my lord?
Words words words
What is the mat- -ter my lord?
Be- -tween who?
I mean the mat- -ter that you read my lord
Slan- -ders sir for the satir- -i- -cal slave says here that old men
have grey beards that their faces are wrin- -kled their eyes
purg- -ing thick am- -ber and plum- -tree gum and that they have a
plen- -ti- -ful lack of wit to- -geth- -er with most weak hams all which
sir though I most pow- -er- -ful- -ly and po- -tent- -ly be- -lieve yet I hold it
not hon- -esty to have it thus set down for you your- -self sir
should be old as I am if like a crab you could go back- -ward
Will you walk out of the air my lord?
In- -to my grave?
In- -deed that is out o' the air [A- -side.] How preg- -nant some- -times
his replies are! a hap- -pi- -ness that of- -ten mad- -ness hits on which
rea- -son and san- -i- -ty could not so pros- -per- -ous- -ly be de- -liv- -ered of I
will leave him and sud- -den- -ly con- -trive the means of meet- -ing be- -tween
him and my daugh- -ter. y hon- -ourable lord I will most humbly take
my leave of you
You can- -not sir take from me any- -thing that I will more
will- -ing- -ly part with- -al, xcept my life ex- -cept my life ex- -cept my
life
Fare you well my lord
These te- -dious old fool- -s!
You go to seek the Lord Ham- -let there he is
My hon- -oured lord!
My most dear lord!
My ex- -cel- -lent good friend- -s! How dost thou Guilden- -stern? Ah
Rosen- -crantz! Good lads how do ye both?
As the in- -dif- -fer- -ent chil- -dren of the earth
Hap- -py in that we are not over- -hap- -py
On for- -tune's cap we are not the very but- -ton
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Nei- -ther my lord
Then you live about her waist or in the mid- -dle of her
favours?
Faith her pri- -vates we
In the se- -cret parts of for- -tune? O most true she is a
strum- -pet What's the news?
None my lord but that the world's grown hon- -est
Then is dooms- -day near but your news is not true Let me
ques- -tion more in par- -tic- -u- -lar what have you my good friends
de- -served at the hands of for- -tune that she sends you to prison
hith- -er?
Prison my lord!
Den- -mark's a prison
Then is the world one
A good- -ly one in which there are many con- -fines wards and
dun- -geons Den- -mark be- -ing one o' the worst
We think not so my lord
Why then 'tis none to you for there is noth- -ing ei- -ther good
or bad but think- -ing makes it so to me it is a prison
Why then your am- -bi- -tion makes it one 'tis too nar- -row for your
mind
O God I could be bound- -ed in a nut- -shell and count my- -self a
king of in- -fi- -nite space were it not that I have bad dreams
Which dreams in- -deed are am- -bi- -tion for the very sub- -stance of
the am- -bi- -tious is mere- -ly the shad- -ow of a dream
A dream it- -self is but a shad- -ow
Tru- -ly and I hold am- -bi- -tion of so airy and light a qual- -i- -ty that
it is but a shad- -ow's shad- -ow
Then are our beg- -gars bod- -ies and our mon- -archs and out- -stretch'd
he- -roes the beg- -gars' shad- -ows Shall we to the court? for by my
fay I can- -not rea- -son
Ros and Guild
We'll wait up- -on you
No such mat- -ter I will not sort you with the rest of my
ser- -vants for to speak to you like an hon- -est man I am most
dread- -ful- -ly at- -tend- -ed But in the beat- -en way of friend- -ship what
make you at Elsi- -nore?
To vis- -it you my lord no oth- -er oc- -ca- -sion
Beg- -gar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you
and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a half- -pen- -ny Were
you not sent for? Is it your own in- -clin- -ing? Is it a free
vis- -i- -ta- -tion? Come deal just- -ly with me come come nay speak
What should we say my lord?
Why any- -thing ut to the pur- -pose You were sent for and
there is a kind of con- -fes- -sion in your looks which your mod- -esties
have not craft enough to colour I know the good king and queen
have sent for you
To what end my lord?
That you must teach me But let me con- -jure you by the rights
of our fel- -low- -ship by the con- -so- -nan- -cy of our youth by the
obli- -ga- -tion of our ev- -er- -p- -re- -served love and by what more dear a
bet- -ter pro- -pos- -er could charge you with- -al be even and di- -rect with
me whether you were sent for or no
not off
My lord we were sent for
I will tell you why so shall my an- -tic- -i- -pa- -tion pre- -vent your
dis- -cov- -ery and your se- -cre- -cy to the king and queen moult no
feath- -er I have of late, ut where- -fore I know not, ost all my
mirth for- -gone all cus- -tom of ex- -er- -cis- -es and in- -deed it goes so
heav- -i- -ly with my dis- -po- -si- -tion that this good- -ly frame the earth
seems to me a ster- -ile promon- -to- -ry this most ex- -cel- -lent canopy the
air look you this brave o'er- -hang- -ing fir- -ma- -ment this ma- -jes- -ti- -cal
roof fret- -ted with gold- -en fire, hy it ap- -pears no oth- -er thing
to me than a foul and pesti- -lent con- -gre- -ga- -tion of vapours What a
piece of work is man! How no- -ble in rea- -son! how in- -fi- -nite in
fac- -ul- -ties! in form and mov- -ing how ex- -press and ad- -mirable! in
ac- -tion how like an an- -gel! in ap- -pre- -hen- -sion how like a god! the
beau- -ty of the world! the paragon of an- -i- -mal- -s! And yet to me what
is this quin- -tes- -sence of dust? Man de- -lights not me no nor wom- -an
nei- -ther though by your smil- -ing you seem to say so
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
Why did you laugh then when I said 'Man de- -lights not me'?
To think my lord if you de- -light not in man what lenten
en- -ter- -tain- -ment the play- -ers shall re- -ceive from you we cot- -ed them
on the way and hith- -er are they com- -ing to of- -fer you ser- -vice
He that plays the king shall be wel- -come, is majesty shall
have trib- -ute of me the ad- -ven- -tur- -ous knight shall use his foil and
tar- -get the lover shall not sigh gratis the hu- -mor- -ous man shall
end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tick- -le o' the sere and the la- -dy shall say her mind
freely or the blank verse shall halt for't What play- -ers are
they?
Even those you were wont to take such de- -light in, he
trage- -di- -ans of the city
How chances it they trav- -el? their res- -i- -dence both in
rep- -u- -ta- -tion and prof- -it was bet- -ter both ways
I think their in- -hi- -bi- -tion comes by the means of the late
in- -no- -va- -tion
Do they hold the same es- -ti- -ma- -tion they did when I was in the
city? Are they so fol- -lowed?
No in- -deed are they not
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
Nay their en- -deav- -our keeps in the wont- -ed pace but there is
sir an aery of chil- -dren lit- -tle eyas- -es that cry out on the top
of ques- -tion and are most tyran- -ni- -cal- -ly clapped for't these are
now the fash- -ion and so be- -rat- -tle the com- -mon stages, o they call
them, hat many wear- -ing rapiers are afraid of goose- -quills and
dare scarce come thith- -er
What are they chil- -dren? who main- -tains 'em? How are they
es- -cot- -ed? Will they pur- -sue the qual- -i- -ty no longer than they can
sing? will they not say af- -ter- -wards if they should grow
them- -selves to com- -mon play- -er- -s, s it is most like if their means
are no bet- -ter, heir writ- -ers do them wrong to make them ex- -claim
against their own suc- -ces- -sion?
Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the na- -tion
holds it no sin to tarre them to con- -tro- -ver- -sy there was for
awhile no mon- -ey bid for ar- -gu- -ment un- -less the po- -et and the play- -er
went to cuffs in the ques- -tion
Is't pos- -si- -ble?
O there has been much throw- -ing about of brains
Do the boys car- -ry it away?
Ay that they do my lord Her- -cules and his load too
It is not very strange for my un- -cle is king of Den- -mark and
those that would make mouths at him while my fa- -ther lived give
twen- -ty forty fifty a hun- -dred ducats a- -- -piece for his pic- -ture in
lit- -tle 'S- -blood there is some- -thing in this more than nat- -u- -ral if
phi- -los- -o- -phy could find it out
There are the play- -ers
Gen- -tle- -men you are wel- -come to Elsi- -nore Your hands come the
ap- -pur- -te- -nance of wel- -come is fash- -ion and cer- -e- -mo- -ny let me com- -ply
with you in this garb lest my ex- -tent to the play- -ers which I
tell you must show fair- -ly out- -ward should more ap- -pear like

Well be with you gen- -tle- -men!
Hark you Guilden- -stern; nd you too; t each ear a hear- -er that

What speech my lord?
I heard thee speak me a speech on- -ce, ut it was nev- -er act- -ed
or if it was not above once for the play I re- -mem- -ber pleased
not the mil- -lion 't- -was caviare to the gen- -er- -al but it was, s I
re- -ceived it and oth- -ers whose judg- -ments in such mat- -ters cried in
the top of mine, n ex- -cel- -lent play well di- -gest- -ed in the scenes
set down with as much mod- -esty as cun- -ning I re- -mem- -ber one said
there were no sal- -lets in the lines to make the mat- -ter savoury
nor no mat- -ter in the phrase that might in- -dite the au- -thor of
af- -fec- -ta- -tion but called it an hon- -est method as whole- -some as
sweet and by very much more hand- -some than fine One speech in it
I chiefly loved 't- -was AE- -neas' tale to Di- -do and there- -about of it
es- -pe- -cial- -ly where he speaks of Pri- -am's slaugh- -ter if it live in
your mem- -o- -ry be- -gin at this line; et me see let me see
The rugged Pyrrhus like th' Hyr- -ca- -ni- -an beast
it is not so it be- -gins with Pyrrhus
'The rugged Pyrrhus, e whose sable arms
Black as his pur- -pose did the night re- -sem- -ble
When he lay couched in the omi- -nous horse
Hath now this dread and black com- -plex- -ion smear'd
With her- -aldry more dis- -mal head to foot
Now is he to- -tal gules hor- -rid- -ly trick- -'d
With blood of fa- -thers moth- -ers daugh- -ters sons
Bak'd and im- -past- -ed with the parch- -ing streets
That lend a tyran- -nous and a damned light
To their vile mur- -ders roast- -ed in wrath and fire
And thus o'er- -sized with co- -ag- -u- -late gore
With eyes like car- -bun- -cles the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grand- -sire Pri- -am seek- -s.'
So pro- -ceed you
'Fore God my lord well spo- -ken with good ac- -cent and good

Anon he finds him
Strik- -ing too short at Greeks his an- -tique sword
Re- -bel- -lious to his arm lies where it falls
Re- -pug- -nant to com- -mand un- -equal match'd
Pyrrhus at Pri- -am drives in rage strikes wide
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The un- -nerved fa- -ther falls Then sense- -less Il- -i- -um
Seem- -ing to feel this blow with flam- -ing top
Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
Takes pris- -on- -er Pyrrhus' ear for lo! his sword
Which was de- -clin- -ing on the milky head
Of rev- -erend Pri- -am seem'd i' the air to stick
So as a paint- -ed tyrant Pyrrhus stood
And like a neu- -tral to his will and mat- -ter
Did noth- -ing
But as we of- -ten see against some storm
A si- -lence in the heav- -ens the rack stand still
The bold winds speech- -less and the orb be- -low
As hush as death anon the dread- -ful thun- -der
Doth rend the re- -gion so af- -ter Pyrrhus' pause
A roused vengeance sets him new a- -- -work
And nev- -er did the Cy- -clop- -s' ham- -mers fall
On Mars's ar- -mour forg'd for proof eterne
With less re- -morse than Pyrrhus' bleed- -ing sword
Now falls on Pri- -am
Out out thou strum- -pet For- -tune! All you gods
In gen- -er- -al syn- -od take away her pow- -er
Break all the spokes and fel- -lies from her wheel
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heav- -en
As low as to the fiend- -s!

But who O who had seen the mobled queen
'The mobled queen'?
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good
I Play
Run bare- -foot up and down threat- -en- -ing the flames
With bis- -son rheum a clout up- -on that head
Where late the di- -a- -dem stood and for a robe
About her lank and all o'er- -teemed loins
A blan- -ket in the alarm of fear caught up
Who this had seen with tongue in ven- -om steep- -'d
'Gainst For- -tune's state would trea- -son have pro- -nounc'd
But if the gods them- -selves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make ma- -li- -cious sport
In minc- -ing with his sword her hus- -band's limbs
The in- -stant burst of clam- -our that she made
Un- -less things mor- -tal move them not at all
Would have made milch the burn- -ing eyes of heav- -en
And pas- -sion in the gods
Look whether he has not turn'd his colour and has tears in- -'s
eye- -s. ray you no more!
'Tis well I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon
Good my lord will you see the play- -ers well be- -stowed? Do you
hear? Let them be well used for they are the ab- -stracts and brief
chron- -i- -cles of the time af- -ter your death you were bet- -ter have a
bad epi- -taph than their ill re- -port while you live
My lord I will use them ac- -cord- -ing to their desert
Odd- -'s bodikin man bet- -ter use ev- -ery man af- -ter his
desert and who should scape whip- -ping? Use them af- -ter your own
hon- -our and dig- -ni- -ty the less they de- -serve the more mer- -it is in
your boun- -ty Take them in
Come sirs
Fol- -low him friends we'll hear a play to- -- -mor- -row
Dost thou hear me old friend? Can you play 'The Mur- -der of
Gon- -zago'?
I Play
Ay my lord
We'll ha't to- -- -mor- -row night You could for a need study a
speech of some dozen or six- -teen lines which I would set down and
in- -sert in- -'t? could you not?
I Play
Ay my lord
Very well. ol- -low that lord and look you mock him not
My good friends [to Ros and Guild.] I'll leave you till
night you are wel- -come to Elsi- -nore
Good my lord!
Ay so God b' wi' ye!
Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peas- -ant slave am I!
Is it not mon- -strous that this play- -er here
But in a fic- -tion in a dream of pas- -sion
Could force his soul so to his own con- -ceit
That from her work- -ing all his vis- -age wan'd
Tears in his eyes dis- -trac- -tion in- -'s as- -pect
A bro- -ken voice and his whole func- -tion suit- -ing
With forms to his con- -ceit? And all for noth- -ing!
For Hecuba?
What's Hecu- -ba to him or he to Hecu- -ba
That he should weep for her? What would he do
Had he the mo- -tive and the cue for pas- -sion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the gen- -er- -al ear with hor- -rid speech
Make mad the guilty and ap- -pal the free
Con- -found the ig- -no- -rant and amaze in- -deed
The very fac- -ul- -ties of eyes and ears
Yet I
A dull and mud- -dy- -met- -tled ras- -cal peak
Like John- -a- -- -dreams un- -preg- -nant of my cause
And can say noth- -ing no not for a king
Up- -on whose prop- -er- -ty and most dear life
A damn'd de- -feat was made Am I a cow- -ard?
Who calls me vil- -lain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this ha?
'S- -wounds I should take it for it can- -not be
But I am pi- -geon- -liv- -er'd and lack gall
To make op- -pres- -sion bit- -ter or ere this
I should have fat- -ted all the re- -gion kites
With this slave's of- -fal bloody bawdy vil- -lain!
Re- -morse- -less treach- -er- -ous lech- -er- -ous kind- -less vil- -lain!
O vengeance!
Why what an ass am I! This is most brave
That I the son of a dear fa- -ther mur- -der'd
Prompt- -ed to my re- -venge by heav- -en and hell
Must like a whore un- -pack my heart with words
And fall a- -curs- -ing like a very drab
A scul- -lion!
Fie up- -on't! fo- -h! bout my brain! I have heard
That guilty crea- -tures sit- -ting at a play
Have by the very cun- -ning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that present- -ly
They have pro- -claim'd their male- -fac- -tions
For mur- -der though it have no tongue will speak
With most mirac- -u- -lous or- -gan I'll have these play- -ers
Play some- -thing like the mur- -der of my fa- -ther
Be- -fore mine un- -cle I'll ob- -serve his looks
I'll tent him to the quick if he but blench
I know my course The spir- -it that I have seen
May be the dev- -il and the dev- -il hath pow- -er
To as- -sume a pleas- -ing shape yea and per- -haps
Out of my weak- -ness and my melan- -choly
As he is very po- -tent with such spir- -its
Abus- -es me to damn me I'll have grounds
More rel- -a- -tive than this. he play's the thing
Where- -in I'll catch the con- -science of the king
And can you by no drift of cir- -cum- -stance
Get from him why he puts on this con- -fu- -sion
Grat- -ing so harsh- -ly all his days of qui- -et
With tur- -bu- -lent and dan- -ger- -ous lu- -na- -cy?
He does con- -fess he feels him- -self dis- -tract- -ed
But from what cause he will by no means speak
Nor do we find him for- -ward to be sound- -ed
But with a crafty mad- -ness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some con- -fes- -sion
Of his true state
Did he re- -ceive you well?
Most like a gen- -tle- -man
But with much forc- -ing of his dis- -po- -si- -tion
Nig- -gard of ques- -tion but of our de- -mands
Most free in his re- -ply
Did you as- -say him
To any pas- -time?
Madam it so fell out that cer- -tain play- -ers
We o'er- -raught on the way of these we told him
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it they are about the court
And as I think they have al- -ready or- -der
This night to play be- -fore him
'Tis most true
And he be- -seech'd me to en- -treat your majesties
To hear and see the mat- -ter
With all my heart and it doth much con- -tent me
To hear him so in- -clin'd
Good gen- -tle- -men give him a fur- -ther edge
And drive his pur- -pose on to these de- -lights
We shall my lord
Sweet Gertrude leave us too
For we have close- -ly sent for Ham- -let hith- -er
That he as 'twere by ac- -ci- -dent may here
Af- -front Ophe- -lia
Her fa- -ther and my- -self, aw- -ful es- -pi- -als
Will so be- -stow our- -selves that see- -ing un- -seen
We may of their en- -counter frankly judge
And gath- -er by him as he is be- -hav'd
If't be the af- -flic- -tion of his love or no
That thus he suf- -fers for
I shall obey you
And for your part Ophe- -lia I do wish
That your good beau- -ties be the hap- -py cause
Of Ham- -let's wild- -ness so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wont- -ed way again
To both your hon- -ours
Madam I wish it may
Ophe- -lia walk you here. racious so please you
We will be- -stow our- -selves. To Ophe- -li- -a.] Read on this book
That show of such an ex- -er- -cise may colour
Your lone- -li- -ness. e are oft to blame in this
'Tis too much prov'd, hat with de- -vo- -tion's vis- -age
And pi- -ous ac- -tion we do sug- -ar o'er
The Dev- -il him- -self
How smart a lash that speech doth give my con- -science!
The har- -lot's cheek beau- -tied with plas- -ter- -ing art
Is not more ug- -ly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most paint- -ed word
O heavy bur- -den!
I hear him com- -ing let's with- -draw my lord
To be or not to be, hat is the ques- -tion
Whether 'tis no- -bler in the mind to suf- -fer
The slings and ar- -rows of out- -ra- -geous for- -tune
Or to take arms against a sea of trou- -bles
And by op- -pos- -ing end them? o die, o sleep
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thou- -sand nat- -u- -ral shocks
That flesh is heir to, tis a con- -sum- -ma- -tion
De- -vout- -ly to be wish'd To die, o sleep
To sleep! per- -chance to dream: y there's the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuf- -fled off this mor- -tal coil
Must give us pause there's the re- -spect
That makes calami- -ty of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The op- -pres- -sor's wrong the proud man's con- -tu- -me- -ly
The pangs of de- -spis'd love the law's de- -lay
The in- -so- -lence of of- -fice and the spurns
That pa- -tient mer- -it of the un- -wor- -thy takes
When he him- -self might his qui- -etus make
With a bare bod- -kin? who would these fardels bear
To grunt and sweat un- -der a weary life
But that the dread of some- -thing af- -ter death
The undis- -cov- -er'd coun- -try from whose bourn
No trav- -eller re- -turn- -s, uz- -zles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to oth- -ers that we know not of?
Thus con- -science does make cow- -ards of us all
And thus the na- -tive hue of res- -o- -lu- -tion
Is sick- -lied o'er with the pale cast of thought
And en- -ter- -pris- -es of great pith and mo- -ment
With this re- -gard their cur- -rents turn awry
And lose the name of ac- -tion. oft you now!
The fair Ophe- -li- -a! ymph in thy orisons
Be all my sins re- -mem- -ber'd
Good my lord
How does your hon- -our for this many a day?
I humbly thank you well well well
My lord I have re- -mem- -brances of yours
That I have longed long to re- -de- -liv- -er
I pray you now re- -ceive them
No not I
I nev- -er gave you aught
My hon- -our'd lord you know right well you did
And with them words of so sweet breath com- -pos'd
As made the things more rich their per- -fume lost
Take these again for to the no- -ble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove un- -kind
There my lord
Ha ha! are you hon- -est?
My lord?
Are you fair?
What means your lord- -ship?
That if you be hon- -est and fair your hon- -esty should ad- -mit no
dis- -course to your beau- -ty
Could beau- -ty my lord have bet- -ter com- -merce than with hon- -esty?
Ay tru- -ly for the pow- -er of beau- -ty will soon- -er trans- -form
hon- -esty from what it is to a bawd than the force of hon- -esty can
trans- -late beau- -ty in- -to his like- -ness this was some- -time a para- -dox
but now the time gives it proof I did love you once
In- -deed my lord you made me be- -lieve so
You should not have be- -liev'd me for virtue can- -not so
in- -oc- -u- -late our old stock but we shall rel- -ish of it I loved you
not
I was the more de- -ceived
Get thee to a nun- -nery why wouldst thou be a breed- -er of
sin- -ner- -s? I am my- -self in- -dif- -fer- -ent hon- -est but yet I could ac- -cuse
me of such things that it were bet- -ter my moth- -er had not borne me
I am very proud re- -venge- -ful am- -bi- -tious with more of- -fences at my
beck than I have thoughts to put them in imag- -i- -na- -tion to give
them shape or time to act them in What should such fel- -lows as I
do crawl- -ing be- -tween earth and heav- -en? We are ar- -rant knaves all
be- -lieve none of us Go thy ways to a nun- -nery Where's your
fa- -ther?
At home my lord
Let the doors be shut up- -on him that he may play the fool
nowhere but in- -'s own house Farewell
O help him you sweet heav- -en- -s!
If thou dost mar- -ry I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry
be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not es- -cape
calum- -ny Get thee to a nun- -nery go farewell Or if thou wilt
needs mar- -ry mar- -ry a fool for wise men know well enough what
mon- -sters you make of them To a nun- -nery go and quick- -ly too
O heav- -en- -ly pow- -ers re- -store him!
I have heard of your paint- -ings too well enough God hath
giv- -en you one face and you make your- -selves an- -oth- -er you jig you
am- -ble and you lisp and nick- -name God's crea- -tures and make your
wan- -ton- -ness your ig- -no- -rance Go to I'll no more on't it hath made
me mad I say we will have no more mar- -riages those that are
mar- -ried al- -ready all but one shall live the rest shall keep as
they are To a nun- -nery go
O what a no- -ble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's schol- -ar's sol- -dier's eye tongue sword
The ex- -pectan- -cy and rose of the fair state
The glass of fash- -ion and the mould of form
The ob- -serv'd of all ob- -server- -s, uite quite down!
And I of ladies most de- -ject and wretch- -ed
That suck- -'d the hon- -ey of his mu- -sic vows
Now see that no- -ble and most sov- -er- -eign rea- -son
Like sweet bells jan- -gled out of tune and harsh
That un- -match'd form and fea- -ture of blown youth
Blast- -ed with ec- -sta- -sy O woe is me
To have seen what I have seen see what I see!
Love! his af- -fec- -tions do not that way tend
Nor what he spake though it lack- -'d form a lit- -tle
Was not like mad- -ness There's some- -thing in his soul
O'er which his melan- -choly sits on brood
And I do doubt the hatch and the dis- -close
Will be some dan- -ger which for to pre- -vent
I have in quick de- -ter- -mi- -na- -tion
Thus set it down: e shall with speed to Eng- -land
For the de- -mand of our ne- -glect- -ed trib- -ute
Hap- -ly the seas and coun- -tries dif- -fer- -ent
With vari- -able ob- -jects shall ex- -pel
This some- -thing- -set- -tled mat- -ter in his heart
Where- -on his brains still beat- -ing puts him thus
From fash- -ion of him- -self What think you on't?
It shall do well but yet do I be- -lieve
The ori- -gin and com- -mence- -ment of his grief
Sprung from ne- -glect- -ed love. ow now Ophe- -li- -a!
You need not tell us what Lord Ham- -let said
We heard it al- -l. y lord do as you please
But if you hold it fit af- -ter the play
Let his queen moth- -er all alone en- -treat him
To show his grief let her be round with him
And I'll be plac'd so please you in the ear
Of all their con- -fer- -ence If she find him not
To Eng- -land send him or con- -fine him where
Your wis- -dom best shall think
It shall be so
Mad- -ness in great ones must not un- -watch'd go
Speak the speech I pray you as I pro- -nounced it to you
trip- -ping- -ly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your
play- -ers do I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
gen- -tly for in the very tor- -rent tem- -pest and as I may say
whirl- -wind of pas- -sion you must ac- -quire and beget a
tem- -per- -ance that may give it smooth- -ness O it of- -fends me to the
soul to hear a ro- -bus- -tious peri- -wig- -- -pat- -ed fel- -low tear a pas- -sion to
tat- -ters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
for the most part are ca- -pa- -ble of noth- -ing but in- -ex- -pli- -ca- -ble dumb
shows and noise I would have such a fel- -low whipped for o'er- -do- -ing
Ter- -ma- -gant it out- -- -herods Herod pray you avoid it
I Play- -er
I war- -rant your hon- -our
Be not too tame nei- -ther but let your own dis- -cre- -tion be your
tu- -tor suit the ac- -tion to the word the word to the ac- -tion with
this spe- -cial ob- -ser- -vance that you o'er- -step not the mod- -esty of
na- -ture for any- -thing so over- -done is from the pur- -pose of play- -ing
whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
'twere the mir- -ror up to na- -ture to show virtue her own im- -age

How now my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
And the queen too and that present- -ly
Bid the play- -ers make haste
Will you two help to has- -ten them?
Ros and Guil
We will my lord
What ho Ho- -r- -a- -tio!
Here sweet lord at your ser- -vice
Ho- -r- -a- -tio thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my con- -ver- -sa- -tion cop'd with- -al
O my dear lord
Nay do not think I flat- -ter
For what ad- -vance- -ment may I hope from thee
That no rev- -enue hast but thy good spir- -its
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flat- -ter'd?
No let the can- -died tongue lick ab- -surd pomp
And crook the preg- -nant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may fol- -low fawn- -ing Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mis- -tress of her choice
And could of men dis- -tin- -guish her elec- -tion
Hath seal'd thee for her- -self for thou hast been
As one in suf- -fer- -ing all that suf- -fers noth- -ing
A man that For- -tune's buf- -fets and re- -wards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks and bles'd are those
Whose blood and judg- -ment are so well com- -min- -gled
That they are not a pipe for For- -tune's fin- -ger
To sound what stop she please Give me that man
That is not pas- -sion's slave and I will wear him
In my heart's core ay in my heart of heart
As I do thee. ome- -thing too much of this
There is a play to- -night be- -fore the king
One scene of it comes near the cir- -cum- -stance
Which I have told thee of my fa- -ther's death
I pr'ythee when thou see'st that act a- -- -foot
Even with the very com- -ment of thy soul
Ob- -serve mine un- -cle if his oc- -cult- -ed guilt
Do not it- -self un- -ken- -nel in one speech
It is a damned ghost that we have seen
And my imag- -i- -na- -tions are as foul
As Vul- -can's stithy Give him heed- -ful note
For I mine eyes will riv- -et to his face
And af- -ter we will both our judg- -ments join
In cen- -sure of his seem- -ing
Well my lord
If he steal aught the whilst this play is play- -ing
And scape de- -tect- -ing I will pay the theft

How fares our cousin Ham- -let?
Ex- -cel- -lent i' faith of the chameleon's dish I eat the air

Ay my lord they stay up- -on your pa- -tience
Come hith- -er my dear Ham- -let sit by me
No good moth- -er here's met- -al more at- -trac- -tive
La- -dy shall I lie in your lap?
No my lord
I mean my head up- -on your lap?
Ay my lord
Do you think I meant coun- -try mat- -ter- -s?
I think noth- -ing my lord
That's a fair thought to lie be- -tween maid- -s' legs
What is my lord?
You are mer- -ry my lord
Who I?
Ay my lord
O your on- -ly jig- -- -mak- -er! What should a man do but be mer- -ry?

Will he tell us what this show mean- -t?
Ay or any show that you'll show him be not you ashamed to
show he'll not shame to tell you what it means
You are naught you are naught I'll mark the play
For us and for our tragedy
Here stoop- -ing to your clemen- -cy
We beg your hear- -ing pa- -tient- -ly
Is this a pro- -logue or the posy of a ring?
'Tis brief my lord
As wom- -an's love
King
Full thir- -ty times hath Phoe- -bus' cart gone round
Nep- -tune's salt wash and Tel- -lus' orbed ground
And thir- -ty dozen moons with bor- -row'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thir- -ties been
Since love our hearts and Hy- -men did our hands
Unite com- -mu- -tu- -al in most sa- -cred bands
Queen
So many jour- -neys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But woe is me you are so sick of late
So far from cheer and from your for- -mer state
That I dis- -trust you Yet though I dis- -trust
Dis- -com- -fort you my lord it noth- -ing must
For wom- -en's fear and love holds quan- -ti- -ty
In nei- -ther aught or in ex- -trem- -i- -ty
Now what my love is proof hath made you know
And as my love is siz'd my fear is so
Where love is great the lit- -tlest doubts are fear
Where lit- -tle fears grow great great love grows there
King
Faith I must leave thee love and short- -ly too
My op- -er- -ant pow- -ers their func- -tions leave to do
And thou shalt live in this fair world be- -hind
Hon- -our'd belov'd and hap- -ly one as kind
For hus- -band shalt thou
Queen
O con- -found the rest!
Such love must needs be trea- -son in my breast
In sec- -ond hus- -band let me be ac- -curst!
None wed the sec- -ond but who kil- -l'd the first
Queen
The in- -stances that sec- -ond mar- -riage move
Are base re- -spects of thrift but none of love
A sec- -ond time I kill my hus- -band dead
When sec- -ond hus- -band kiss- -es me in bed
King
I do be- -lieve you think what now you speak
But what we do de- -ter- -mine oft we break
Pur- -pose is but the slave to mem- -o- -ry
Of vi- -o- -lent birth but poor va- -lid- -i- -ty
Which now like fruit un- -ripe sticks on the tree
But fall un- -shak- -en when they mel- -low be
Most nec- -es- -sary 'tis that we for- -get
To pay our- -selves what to our- -selves is debt
What to our- -selves in pas- -sion we pro- -pose
The pas- -sion end- -ing doth the pur- -pose lose
The vi- -o- -lence of ei- -ther grief or joy
Their own en- -ac- -tures with them- -selves de- -stroy
Where joy most rev- -els grief doth most lament
Grief joys joy grieves on slen- -der ac- -ci- -dent
This world is not for aye nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our for- -tunes change
For 'tis a ques- -tion left us yet to prove
Whether love lead for- -tune or else for- -tune love
The great man down you mark his favourite flies
The poor ad- -vanc'd makes friends of en- -e- -mies
And hith- -er- -to doth love on for- -tune tend
For who not needs shall nev- -er lack a friend
And who in want a hol- -low friend doth try
Di- -rect- -ly sea- -sons him his en- -e- -my
But or- -der- -ly to end where I be- -gun
Our wills and fates do so con- -trary run
That our de- -vices still are over- -thrown
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no sec- -ond hus- -band wed
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
Queen
Nor earth to me give food nor heav- -en light!
Sport and re- -pose lock from me day and night!
To des- -per- -a- -tion turn my trust and hope!
An an- -chor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each op- -po- -site that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it de- -stroy!
Both here and hence pur- -sue me last- -ing strife
If once a wid- -ow ev- -er I be wife!
King
'Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
My spir- -its grow dull and fain I would be- -guile
The te- -dious day with sleep
Queen
Sleep rock thy brain
And nev- -er come mis- -chance be- -tween us twain!
Madam how like you this play?

This is one Lu- -cianus nephew to the King
You are a good cho- -rus my lord
I could in- -ter- -pret be- -tween you and your love if I could see
the pup- -pets dal- -ly- -ing
You are keen my lord you are keen
It would cost you a groan- -ing to take off my edge
Still bet- -ter and worse

How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play
Give me some light: way!
Lights lights light- -s!
Why let the struck- -en deer go weep
The hart un- -galled play
For some must watch while some must sleep
So runs the world away
Would not this sir and a for- -est of feath- -ers f the rest of my
for- -tunes turn Turk with me, ith two Pro- -vin- -cial ros- -es on my
razed shoes get me a fel- -low- -ship in a cry of play- -ers sir?
Half a share
A whole one I
For thou dost know O Da- -mon dear
This realm dis- -man- -tled was
Of Jove him- -self and now reigns here
A very very ajock
You might have rhymed
O good Ho- -r- -a- -tio I'll take the ghost's word for a thou- -sand
pound! Didst per- -ceive?
Very well my lord
Up- -on the talk of the poi- -son- -ing?
I did very well note him
Ah ha! ome some mu- -sic! Come the recorder- -s!
For if the king like not the com- -e- -dy
Why then be- -like he likes it not perdy
Come some mu- -sic!
Good my lord vouch- -safe me a word with you
Sir a whole his- -to- -ry
The king sir
Ay sir what of him?
Is in his re- -tire- -ment mar- -vel- -lous dis- -tem- -pered
With drink sir?
No my lord rather with choler
Your wis- -dom should show it- -self more rich- -er to sig- -ni- -fy this to
the doc- -tor for me to put him to his pur- -ga- -tion would per- -haps
plunge him in- -to far more choler
Good my lord put your dis- -course in- -to some frame and start
not so wild- -ly from my af- -fair
I am tame sir: ro- -nounce
The queen your moth- -er in most great af- -flic- -tion of spir- -it
hath sent me to you
You are wel- -come
Nay good my lord this cour- -tesy is not of the right breed
If it shall please you to make me a whole- -some an- -swer I will do
your moth- -er's com- -mand- -ment if not your par- -don and my re- -turn
shall be the end of my busi- -ness
Sir I can- -not
What my lord?
Make you a whole- -some an- -swer my wit's dis- -eased but sir such
an- -swer as I can make you shall com- -mand or rather as you say
my moth- -er there- -fore no more but to the mat- -ter my moth- -er you
say
Then thus she says your be- -hav- -iour hath struck her in- -to
amaze- -ment and ad- -mi- -ra- -tion
O won- -der- -ful son that can so ston- -ish a moth- -er! ut is there no
se- -quel at the heels of this moth- -er's ad- -mi- -ra- -tion?
She de- -sires to speak with you in her clos- -et ere you go to bed
We shall obey were she ten times our moth- -er Have you any
fur- -ther trade with us?
My lord you once did love me
And so I do still by these pick- -ers and steal- -ers
Good my lord what is your cause of dis- -tem- -per? you do sure- -ly
bar the door up- -on your own lib- -er- -ty if you de- -ny your griefs to
your friend
Sir I lack ad- -vance- -ment
How can that be when you have the voice of the king him- -self
for your suc- -ces- -sion in Den- -mark?
Ay sir but 'While the grass grows' he proverb is some- -thing
musty
O the recorder- -s: et me see one. o with- -draw with you: hy do
you go about to re- -cov- -er the wind of me as if you would drive me
in- -to a toil?
O my lord if my du- -ty be too bold my love is too un- -man- -ner- -ly
I do not well un- -der- -stand that Will you play up- -on this pipe?
My lord I can- -not
I pray you
Be- -lieve me I can- -not
I do be- -seech you
I know no touch of it my lord
'Tis as easy as ly- -ing gov- -ern these ven- -t- -ages with your
fin- -ger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will
dis- -course most elo- -quent mu- -sic Look you these are the stops
But these can- -not I com- -mand to any ut- -ter- -ance of har- -mo- -ny I
have not the skill
Why look you now how un- -wor- -thy a thing you make of me! You
would play up- -on me you would seem to know my stops you would
pluck out the heart of my mys- -tery you would sound me from my
low- -est note to the top of my com- -pass and there is much mu- -sic
ex- -cel- -lent voice in this lit- -tle or- -gan yet can- -not you make it
speak 'S- -blood do you think I am eas- -i- -er to be played on than a
pipe? Call me what in- -stru- -ment you will though you can fret me
you can- -not play up- -on me
God bless you sir!
My lord the queen would speak with you and present- -ly
Do you see yon- -der cloud that's al- -most in shape of a camel?
By the mass and 'tis like a camel in- -deed
Me- -thinks it is like a weasel
It is backed like a weasel
Or like a whale
Very like a whale
Then will I come to my moth- -er by and by. hey fool me to the
top of my ben- -t. will come by and by
I will say so
By- -and- -- -by is eas- -i- -ly said
Leave me friends
'Tis now the very witch- -ing time of night
When church- -yards yawn and hell it- -self breathes out
Con- -ta- -gion to this world now could I drink hot blood
And do such bit- -ter busi- -ness as the day
Would quake to look on Soft! now to my moth- -er
O heart lose not thy na- -ture let not ev- -er
The soul of Nero en- -ter this firm bo- -som
Let me be cru- -el not un- -nat- -u- -ral
I will speak dag- -gers to her but use none
My tongue and soul in this be hyp- -ocrites
How in my words somev- -er she be shent
To give them seals nev- -er my soul con- -sen- -t!
I like him not nor stands it safe with us
To let his mad- -ness range There- -fore pre- -pare you
I your com- -mis- -sion will forth- -with dis- -patch
And he to Eng- -land shall along with you
The terms of our es- -tate may not en- -dure
Haz- -ard so near us as doth hourly grow
Out of his lu- -na- -cies
We will our- -selves pro- -vide
Most holy and re- -li- -gious fear it is
To keep those many many bod- -ies safe
That live and feed up- -on your majesty
The sin- -gle and pe- -cu- -liar life is bound
With all the strength and ar- -mour of the mind
To keep it- -self from 'noy- -ance but much more
That spir- -it up- -on whose weal de- -pend and rest
The lives of many The cease of majesty
Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
What's near it with it it is a massy wheel
Fix'd on the sum- -mit of the high- -est mount
To whose huge spokes ten thou- -sand less- -er things
Are mor- -tis'd and ad- -join'd which when it falls
Each small an- -nex- -ment pet- -ty con- -se- -quence
At- -tends the bois- -ter- -ous ru- -in Nev- -er alone
Did the king sigh but with a gen- -er- -al groan
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voy- -age
For we will fet- -ters put up- -on this fear
Which now goes too free- -- -foot- -ed
Ros and Guil
We will haste us
My lord he's go- -ing to his moth- -er's clos- -et
Be- -hind the ar- -ras I'll con- -vey my- -self
To hear the process I'll war- -rant she'll tax him home
And as you said and wise- -ly was it said
'Tis meet that some more au- -di- -ence than a moth- -er
Since na- -ture makes them par- -tial should o'er- -hear
The speech of van- -tage Fare you well my liege
I'll call up- -on you ere you go to bed
And tell you what I know
Thanks dear my lord
O my of- -fence is rank it smells to heav- -en
It hath the pri- -mal el- -dest curse up- -on't
A broth- -er's mur- -der! ray can I not
Though in- -cli- -na- -tion be as sharp as will
My stronger guilt de- -feats my strong in- -tent
And like a man to dou- -ble busi- -ness bound
I stand in pause where I shall first be- -gin
And both ne- -glect What if this cursed hand
Were thick- -er than it- -self with broth- -er's blood
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heav- -ens
To wash it white as snow? Where- -to serves mer- -cy
But to con- -front the vis- -age of of- -fence?
And what's in prayer but this twofold force
To be fore- -stalled ere we come to fall
Or par- -don'd be- -ing down? Then I'll look up
My fault is past But O what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? For- -give me my foul mur- -der!
That can- -not be since I am still pos- -sess'd
Of those ef- -fects for which I did the mur- -der
My crown mine own am- -bi- -tion and my queen
May one be par- -don'd and re- -tain the of- -fence?
In the cor- -rupt- -ed cur- -rents of this world
Of- -fence's gild- -ed hand may shove by jus- -tice
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize it- -self
Buys out the law but 'tis not so above
There is no shuf- -fling; here the ac- -tion lies
In his true na- -ture and we our- -selves com- -pel- -l'd
Even to the teeth and fore- -head of our faults
To give in ev- -i- -dence What then? what rest- -s?
Try what re- -pen- -tance can what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can- -not re- -pen- -t?
O wretch- -ed state! O bo- -som black as death!
O limed soul that strug- -gling to be free
Art more en- -gag'd! Help an- -gel- -s! Make as- -say
Bow stub- -born knees and heart with strings of steel
Be soft as sinews of the new- -born babe!
All may be well
Now might I do it pat now he is pray- -ing
And now I'll do't; nd so he goes to heav- -en
And so am I re- -veng'd. hat would be scan- -n'd
A vil- -lain kills my fa- -ther and for that
I his sole son do this same vil- -lain send
To heav- -en
O this is hire and salary not re- -venge
He took my fa- -ther gross- -ly full of bread
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
And how his au- -dit stands who knows save heav- -en?
But in our cir- -cum- -stance and course of thought
'Tis heavy with him and am I then re- -veng'd
To take him in the purg- -ing of his soul
When he is fit and sea- -son'd for his pas- -sage?
Up sword and know thou a more hor- -rid hent
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
Or in the in- -ces- -tu- -ous plea- -sure of his bed
At gam- -ing swear- -ing or about some act
That has no rel- -ish of sal- -va- -tion in- -'t
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heav- -en
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell where- -to it goes My moth- -er stays
This physic but pro- -longs thy sick- -ly days
My words fly up my thoughts re- -main be- -low
Words with- -out thoughts nev- -er to heav- -en go
He will come straight Look you lay home to him
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood be- -tween
Much heat and him I'll si- -lence me e'en here
Pray you be round with him
I'll war- -rant you
Fear me not: ith- -draw I hear him com- -ing
Now moth- -er what's the mat- -ter?
Ham- -let thou hast thy fa- -ther much of- -fend- -ed
Moth- -er you have my fa- -ther much of- -fend- -ed
Come come you an- -swer with an idle tongue
Go go you ques- -tion with a wicked tongue
Why how now Ham- -let!
What's the mat- -ter now?
Have you for- -got me?
No by the rood not so
You are the Queen your hus- -band's broth- -er's wife
And, ould it were not so! ou are my moth- -er
Nay then I'll set those to you that can speak
Come come and sit you down you shall not budge
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the in- -most part of you
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not mur- -der me?
Help help ho!
Dead for a ducat dead!
O me what hast thou done?
Nay I know not is it the king?
O what a rash and bloody deed is this!
A bloody deed! lmost as bad good moth- -er
As kill a king and mar- -ry with his broth- -er
As kill a king!
Ay la- -dy 't- -was my word
Thou wretch- -ed rash in- -trud- -ing fool farewell!
I took thee for thy bet- -ter take thy for- -tune
Thou find- -'st to be too busy is some dan- -ger
Leave wring- -ing of your hands peace! sit you down
And let me wring your heart for so I shall
If it be made of pen- -e- -tra- -ble stuff
If damned cus- -tom have not braz'd it so
That it is proof and bul- -wark against sense
What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of mod- -esty
Calls virtue hyp- -ocrite takes off the rose
From the fair fore- -head of an in- -no- -cent love
And sets a blis- -ter there makes mar- -riage- -vows
As false as dicer- -s' oaths O such a deed
As from the body of con- -trac- -tion plucks
The very soul and sweet re- -li- -gion makes
A rhap- -sody of words heav- -en's face doth glow
Yea this so- -lid- -i- -ty and com- -pound mass
With trist- -ful vis- -age as against the doom
Is thought- -sick at the act
Ah me what act
That roars so loud and thun- -ders in the in- -dex?
Look here up- -on this pic- -ture and on this
The coun- -ter- -feit pre- -sent- -ment of two broth- -ers
See what a grace was seat- -ed on this brow
Hy- -pe- -r- -i- -on's curls the front of Jove him- -self
An eye like Mars to threat- -en and com- -mand
A sta- -tion like the her- -ald Mer- -cury
New light- -ed on a heav- -en- -kiss- -ing hill
A com- -bi- -na- -tion and a form in- -deed
Where ev- -ery god did seem to set his seal
To give the world as- -sur- -ance of a man
This was your hus- -band. ook you now what fol- -lows
Here is your hus- -band like a milldew'd ear
Blast- -ing his whole- -some broth- -er Have you eye- -s?
Could you on this fair moun- -tain leave to feed
And bat- -ten on this moor? Ha! have you eye- -s?
You can- -not call it love for at your age
The hey- -- -day in the blood is tame it's hum- -ble
And waits up- -on the judg- -ment and what judg- -ment
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have
Else could you not have mo- -tion but sure that sense
Is apoplex'd for mad- -ness would not err
Nor sense to ec- -sta- -cy was ne'er so thral- -l'd
But it re- -serv'd some quan- -ti- -ty of choice
To serve in such a dif- -fer- -ence What dev- -il was't
That thus hath coz- -en'd you at hood- -man- -blind?
Eyes with- -out feel- -ing feel- -ing with- -out sight
Ears with- -out hands or eyes smelling sans all
Or but a sick- -ly part of one true sense
Could not so mope
O shame! where is thy blush? Re- -bel- -lious hell
If thou canst mu- -tine in a ma- -tron's bones
To flam- -ing youth let virtue be as wax
And melt in her own fire pro- -claim no shame
When the com- -pul- -sive ar- -dour gives the charge
Since frost it- -self as ac- -tive- -ly doth burn
And rea- -son pan- -ders will
O Ham- -let speak no more
Thou turn'st mine eyes in- -to my very soul
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct
Nay but to live
In the rank sweat of an en- -seamed bed
Stew'd in cor- -rup- -tion hon- -ey- -ing and mak- -ing love
Over the nasty sty
O speak to me no more
These words like dag- -gers en- -ter in mine ears
No more sweet Ham- -let
A mur- -der- -er and a vil- -lain
A slave that is not twen- -ti- -eth part the tithe
Of your prece- -dent lord a vice of kings
A cut- -purse of the em- -pire and the rule
That from a shelf the pre- -cious di- -a- -dem stole
And put it in his pock- -et!
No more
A king of shreds and patch- -es!
Save me and hov- -er o'er me with your wings
You heav- -en- -ly guard- -s! hat would your gra- -cious fig- -ure?
Alas he's mad!
Do you not come your tardy son to chide
That lap- -s'd in time and pas- -sion lets go by
The im- -por- -tant act- -ing of your dread com- -mand?
O say!
Do not for- -get This vis- -i- -ta- -tion
Is but to whet thy al- -most blunt- -ed pur- -pose
But look amaze- -ment on thy moth- -er sits
O step be- -tween her and her fight- -ing soul
Con- -ceit in weak- -est bod- -ies strong- -est works
Speak to her Ham- -let
How is it with you la- -dy?
Alas how is't with you
That you do bend your eye on va- -can- -cy
And with the in- -cor- -po- -ral air do hold dis- -course?
Forth at your eyes your spir- -its wild- -ly peep
And as the sleep- -ing sol- -diers in the alarm
Your bed- -ded hairs like life in ex- -cre- -ments
Start up and stand an end O gen- -tle son
Up- -on the heat and flame of thy dis- -tem- -per
Sprin- -kle cool pa- -tience! Where- -on do you look?
On him on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause con- -join'd preach- -ing to stones
Would make them ca- -pa- -ble. o not look up- -on me
Lest with this piteous ac- -tion you con- -vert
My stern ef- -fects then what I have to do
Will want true colour tears per- -chance for blood
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see noth- -ing there?
Noth- -ing at all yet all that is I see
Nor did you noth- -ing hear?
No noth- -ing but our- -selves
Why look you there! look how it steals away!
My fa- -ther in his habit as he liv'd!
Look where he goes even now out at the por- -tal!
This is the very coinage of your brain
This bod- -i- -less cre- -ation ec- -sta- -sy
Is very cun- -ning in
Ec- -sta- -sy!
My pulse as yours doth tem- -per- -ate- -ly keep time
And makes as health- -ful mu- -sic it is not mad- -ness
That I have ut- -ter'd bring me to the test
And I the mat- -ter will re- -- -word which mad- -ness
Would gam- -bol from Moth- -er for love of grace
Lay not that flat- -ter- -ing unc- -tion to your soul
That not your tres- -pass but my mad- -ness speaks
It will but skin and film the ul- -cer- -ous place
Whilst rank cor- -rup- -tion min- -ing all with- -in
In- -fects un- -seen Con- -fess your- -self to heav- -en
Re- -pent what's past avoid what is to come
And do not spread the com- -post on the weeds
To make them ranker For- -give me this my virtue
For in the fat- -ness of these pursy times
Virtue it- -self of vice must par- -don beg
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
O Ham- -let thou hast cleft my heart in twain
O throw away the wors- -er part of it
And live the pur- -er with the oth- -er half
Good night but go not to mine un- -cle's bed
As- -sume a virtue if you have it not
That mon- -ster cus- -tom who all sense doth eat
Of habits evil is an- -gel yet in this
That to the use of ac- -tions fair and good
He like- -wise gives a frock or liv- -ery
That apt- -ly is put on Re- -frain to- -night
And that shall lend a kind of eas- -i- -ness
To the next ab- -sti- -nence the next more easy
For use al- -most can change the stamp of na- -ture
And ei- -ther curb the dev- -il or throw him out
With won- -drous po- -ten- -cy Once more good- -night
And when you are de- -sirous to be bles'd
I'll bless- -ing beg of you. or this same lord
I do re- -pent but heav- -en hath pleas'd it so
To pun- -ish me with this and this with me
That I must be their scourge and min- -is- -ter
I will be- -stow him and will an- -swer well
The death I gave him So again good- -night
I must be cru- -el on- -ly to be kind
Thus bad be- -gins and worse re- -mains be- -hind
One word more good la- -dy
What shall I do?
Not this by no means that I bid you do
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
Pinch wan- -ton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kiss- -es
Or pad- -dling in your neck with his damn'd fin- -gers
Make you to rav- -el all this mat- -ter out
That I es- -sen- -tial- -ly am not in mad- -ness
But mad in craft 'Twere good you let him know
For who that's but a queen fair sober wise
Would from a pad- -dock from a bat a gib
Such dear con- -cern- -ings hide? who would do so?
No in de- -spite of sense and se- -cre- -cy
Un- -peg the bas- -ket on the house- -'s top
Let the birds fly and like the fa- -mous ape
To try con- -clu- -sions in the bas- -ket creep
And break your own neck down
Be thou as- -sur'd if words be made of breath
And breath of life I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me
I must to Eng- -land you know that?
Alack
I had for- -got 'tis so con- -clud- -ed on
There's let- -ters seal'd and my two schoolfel- -lows
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd
They bear the man- -date they must sweep my way
And mar- -shal me to knav- -ery Let it work
For 'tis the sport to have the en- -gin- -er
Hoist with his own petard and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard be- -low their mines
And blow them at the moon O 'tis most sweet
When in one line two crafts di- -rect- -ly meet
This man shall set me pack- -ing
I'll lug the guts in- -to the neigh- -bour room
Moth- -er good- -night. ndeed this coun- -sel- -lor
Is now most still most se- -cret and most grave
Who was in life a fool- -ish peat- -ing knave
Come sir to draw to- -ward an end with you
Good night moth- -er
There's mat- -ter in these sighs These pro- -found heaves
You must trans- -late 'tis fit we un- -der- -stand them
Where is your son?
Be- -stow this place on us a lit- -tle while
Ah my good lord what have I seen to- -night!
What Gertrude? How does Ham- -let?
Mad as the sea and wind when both con- -tend
Which is the might- -i- -er in his law- -less fit
Be- -hind the ar- -ras hear- -ing some- -thing stir
Whips out his rapi- -er cries 'A rat a rat!'
And in this brain- -ish ap- -pre- -hen- -sion kills
The un- -seen good old man
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us had we been there
His lib- -er- -ty is full of threats to all
To you your- -self to us to ev- -ery one
Alas how shall this bloody deed be an- -swer'd?
It will be laid to us whose prov- -i- -dence
Should have kept short re- -strain'd and out of haunt
This mad young man But so much was our love
We would not un- -der- -stand what was most fit
But like the own- -er of a foul dis- -ease
To keep it from di- -vulging let it feed
Even on the pith of life Where is he gone?
To draw apart the body he hath kil- -l'd
O'er whom his very mad- -ness like some ore
Among a min- -er- -al of met- -als base
Shows it- -self pure he weeps for what is done
O Gertrude come away!
The sun no soon- -er shall the moun- -tains touch
But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both coun- -te- -nance and ex- -cuse. o Guilden- -stern!
Friends both go join you with some fur- -ther aid
Ham- -let in mad- -ness hath Polo- -nius slain
And from his moth- -er's clos- -et hath he drag- -g'd him
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
In- -to the chapel I pray you haste in this
Come Gertrude we'll call up our wis- -est friends
And let them know both what we mean to do
And what's un- -time- -ly done so hap- -ly slan- -der
Whose whis- -per o'er the world's di- -am- -e- -ter
As lev- -el as the can- -non to his blank
Trans- -ports his poi- -son'd shot, ay miss our name
And hit the wound- -less air. come away!
My soul is full of dis- -cord and dis- -may
Safe- -ly stowed
Ros and Guil
What noise? who calls on Ham- -let? O here they come
What have you done my lord with the dead body?
Com- -pound- -ed it with dust where- -to 'tis kin
Tell us where 'tis that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel
Do not be- -lieve it
Be- -lieve what?
That I can keep your coun- -sel and not mine own Be- -sides to be
de- -mand- -ed of a sponge! hat repli- -ca- -tion should be made by the son
of a king?
Take you me for a sponge my lord?
Ay sir that soaks up the King's coun- -te- -nance his re- -wards
his au- -thor- -i- -ties But such of- -fi- -cers do the king best ser- -vice in
the end he keeps them like an ape in the cor- -ner of his jaw
first mouthed to be last swal- -lowed when he needs what you have
gleaned it is but squeez- -ing you and sponge you shall be dry
again
I un- -der- -stand you not my lord
I am glad of it a knav- -ish speech sleeps in a fool- -ish ear
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
the king
The body is with the king but the king is not with the body
The king is a thing
A thing my lord!
Of noth- -ing bring me to him Hide fox and all af- -ter
I have sent to seek him and to find the body
How dan- -ger- -ous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
He's lov'd of the dis- -tract- -ed mul- -ti- -tude
Who like not in their judg- -ment but their eyes
And where 'tis so the of- -fend- -er's scourge is weigh'd
But nev- -er the of- -fence To bear all smooth and even
This sud- -den send- -ing him away must seem
De- -lib- -er- -ate pause dis- -eases des- -per- -ate grown
By des- -per- -ate ap- -pli- -ance are re- -liev'd
Or not at all
How now! what hath be- -fal- -l'n?
Where the dead body is be- -stow'd my lord
We can- -not get from him
But where is he?
With- -out my lord guard- -ed to know your plea- -sure
Bring him be- -fore us
Ho Guilden- -stern! bring in my lord
Now Ham- -let where's Polo- -nius?
At sup- -per
At sup- -per! where?
Not where he eats but where he is eat- -en a cer- -tain
con- -vo- -ca- -tion of politic worms are e'en at him Your worm is your
on- -ly em- -per- -or for di- -et we fat all crea- -tures else to fat us and
we fat our- -selves for mag- -gots your fat king and your lean beg- -gar
is but vari- -able ser- -vice, wo dish- -es but to one ta- -ble that's
the end
Alas alas!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm
What dost thou mean by this?
Noth- -ing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
the guts of a beg- -gar
Where is Polo- -nius?
In heav- -en send thith- -er to see if your mes- -sen- -ger find him not
there seek him i' the oth- -er place your- -self But in- -deed if you
find him not with- -in this month you shall nose him as you go up
the stairs in- -to the lob- -by
He will stay till you come
Ham- -let this deed for thine es- -pe- -cial safe- -ty
Which we do ten- -der as we dear- -ly grieve
For that which thou hast done, ust send thee hence
With fiery quick- -ness there- -fore pre- -pare thy- -self
The bark is ready and the wind at help
The as- -so- -ciates tend and ev- -ery- -thing is bent
For Eng- -land
For Eng- -land!
Ay Ham- -let
So is it if thou knew'st our pur- -pos- -es
I see a cherub that sees them. ut come for Eng- -land!
Farewell dear moth- -er
Thy lov- -ing fa- -ther Ham- -let
My moth- -er fa- -ther and moth- -er is man and wife man and wife is
one flesh and so my moth- -er. ome for Eng- -land!
Fol- -low him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
De- -lay it not I'll have him hence to- -night
Away! for ev- -ery- -thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the af- -fair pray you make haste
And Eng- -land if my love thou hold'st at aught
As my great pow- -er there- -of may give thee sense
Since yet thy ci- -ca- -trice looks raw and red
Af- -ter the Dan- -ish sword and thy free awe
Pays homage to us, hou mayst not cold- -ly set
Our sov- -er- -eign process which im- -ports at full
By let- -ters con- -jur- -ing to that ef- -fect
The present death of Ham- -let Do it Eng- -land
For like the hec- -tic in my blood he rages
And thou must cure me till I know 'tis done
Howe'er my haps my joys were ne'er be- -gun
Go Cap- -tain from me greet the Dan- -ish king
Tell him that by his li- -cense Fort- -in- -bras
Craves the con- -veyance of a promis'd march
Over his king- -dom You know the ren- -dezvous
If that his majesty would aught with us
We shall ex- -press our du- -ty in his eye
And let him know so
I will do't my lord
Go soft- -ly on
Good sir whose pow- -ers are the- -se?
They are of Nor- -way sir
How pur- -pos'd sir I pray you?
Against some part of Poland
Who com- -mands them sir?
The nephew to old Nor- -way Fort- -in- -bras
Goes it against the main of Poland sir
Or for some fron- -tier?
Tru- -ly to speak and with no ad- -di- -tion
We go to gain a lit- -tle patch of ground
That hath in it no prof- -it but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
Nor will it yield to Nor- -way or the Pole
A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
Why then the Po- -lack nev- -er will de- -fend it
Yes it is al- -ready gar- -rison'd
Two thou- -sand souls and twen- -ty thou- -sand ducats
Will not de- -bate the ques- -tion of this straw
This is the im- -posthume of much wealth and peace
That in- -ward breaks and shows no cause with- -out
Why the man dies. humbly thank you sir
God b' wi' you sir
Will't please you go my lord?
I'll be with you straight Go a lit- -tle be- -fore
How all oc- -ca- -sions do in- -form against me
And spur my dull re- -venge! What is a man
If his chief good and mar- -ket of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large dis- -course
Look- -ing be- -fore and af- -ter gave us not
That ca- -pa- -bil- -i- -ty and god- -like rea- -son
To fust in us un- -us'd Now whether it be
Bes- -tial obliv- -ion or some craven scru- -ple
Of think- -ing too pre- -cise- -ly on the event
A thought which quar- -ter'd hath but one part wis- -dom
And ev- -er three parts cow- -ard, do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't Ex- -am- -ples gross as earth ex- -hort me
Wit- -ness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a del- -i- -cate and ten- -der prince
Whose spir- -it with di- -vine am- -bi- -tion puff'd
Makes mouths at the in- -vis- -i- -ble event
Ex- -pos- -ing what is mor- -tal and un- -sure
To all that for- -tune death and dan- -ger dare
Even for an egg- -shell Right- -ly to be great
Is not to stir with- -out great ar- -gu- -ment
But great- -ly to find quar- -rel in a straw
When hon- -our's at the stake How stand I then
That have a fa- -ther kil- -l'd a moth- -er stain'd
Ex- -cite- -ments of my rea- -son and my blood
And let all sleep? while to my shame I see
The im- -mi- -nent death of twen- -ty thou- -sand men
That for a fan- -ta- -sy and trick of fame
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
Where- -on the num- -bers can- -not try the cause
Which is not tomb enough and con- -ti- -nent
To hide the slain? from this time forth
My thoughts be bloody or be noth- -ing worth!
I will not speak with her
She is im- -por- -tu- -nate in- -deed dis- -tract
Her mood will needs be pitied
What would she have?
She speaks much of her fa- -ther says she hears
There's tricks i' the world and hems and beats her heart
Spurns en- -vi- -ous- -ly at straws speaks things in doubt
That car- -ry but half sense her speech is noth- -ing
Yet the un- -shaped use of it doth move
The hear- -ers to col- -lec- -tion they aim at it
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
Which as her winks and nods and ges- -tures yield them
In- -deed would make one think there might be thought
Though noth- -ing sure yet much un- -hap- -pi- -ly
'Twere good she were spo- -ken with for she may strew
Dan- -ger- -ous con- -jec- -tures in il- -l- -breed- -ing minds
Let her come in
To my sick soul as sin's true na- -ture is
Each toy seems Pro- -logue to some great amiss
So full of art- -less jeal- -ousy is guilt
It spills it- -self in fear- -ing to be spilt
Where is the beau- -teous majesty of Den- -mark?
How now Ophe- -li- -a?
How should I your true love know
From an- -oth- -er one?
By his cock- -le bat and' staff
And his san- -dal shoon
Alas sweet la- -dy what im- -ports this song?
Say you? nay pray you mark
He is dead and gone la- -dy
He is dead and gone
At his head a grass green turf
At his heels a stone
Nay but Ophe- -lia
Pray you mark
White his shroud as the moun- -tain snow
Alas look here my lord!
Lard- -ed all with sweet flow- -ers
Which be- -wept to the grave did go
With true- -love show- -ers
How do you pret- -ty la- -dy?
Well God dild you! They say the owl was a bak- -er's daugh- -ter
Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be God be at
your table!
Con- -ceit up- -on her fa- -ther
Pray you let's have no words of this but when they ask you what
it means say you this
To- -- -mor- -row is Saint Valen- -tine's day
All in the morn- -ing bed- -time
And I a maid at your win- -dow
To be your Valen- -tine
Then up he rose and don- -n'd his clothes
And dup- -p'd the cham- -ber door
Let in the maid that out a maid
Nev- -er de- -part- -ed more
Pret- -ty Ophe- -li- -a!
In- -deed la with- -out an oath I'll make an end on't
By Gis and by Saint Char- -i- -ty
Alack and fie for shame!
Young men will do't if they come to't
By cock they are to blame
Quoth she be- -fore you tum- -bled me
You promis'd me to wed
So would I ha' done by yon- -der sun
An thou hadst not come to my bed
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well We must be pa- -tient but I can- -not
choose but weep to think they would lay him i' the cold ground
My broth- -er shall know of it and so I thank you for your good
coun- -sel. ome my coach! ood night ladies good night sweet
ladies good night good night
Fol- -low her close give her good watch I pray you
O this is the poi- -son of deep grief it springs
All from her fa- -ther's death O Gertrude Gertrude
When sor- -rows come they come not sin- -gle spies
But in bat- -tal- -ion- -s! First her fa- -ther slain
Next your son gone and he most vi- -o- -lent au- -thor
Of his own just re- -move the peo- -ple mud- -died
Thick and and un- -whole- -some in their thoughts and whis- -pers
For good Polo- -nius' death and we have done but green- -ly
In hug- -ger- -- -mug- -ger to in- -ter him poor Ophe- -lia
Di- -vid- -ed from her- -self and her fair judg- -ment
With- -out the which we are pic- -tures or mere beasts
Last and as much con- -tain- -ing as all these
Her broth- -er is in se- -cret come from France
Feeds on his won- -der keeps him- -self in clouds
And wants not buzzers to in- -fect his ear
With pesti- -lent speech- -es of his fa- -ther's death
Where- -in ne- -ces- -si- -ty of mat- -ter beg- -gar'd
Will noth- -ing stick our per- -son to ar- -raign
In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
Like to a mur- -der- -ing piece in many places
Give me su- -per- -flu- -ous death
Alack what noise is this?
Where are my Switzer- -s? let them guard the door
What is the mat- -ter?
Save your- -self my lord
The ocean over- -peer- -ing of his list
Eats not the flats with more im- -petu- -ous haste
Than young Laertes in a ri- -otous head
O'er- -bears your of- -fices The rab- -ble call him lord
And as the world were now but to be- -gin
An- -tiq- -ui- -ty for- -got cus- -tom not known
The rat- -i- -fiers and props of ev- -ery word
They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
Caps hands and tongues ap- -plaud it to the clouds
'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
How cheer- -ful- -ly on the false trail they cry!
O this is counter you false Dan- -ish dogs!
The doors are broke
Where is this king? irs stand you all with- -out
No let's come in
I pray you give me leave
We will we will
I thank you: eep the door. thou vile king
Give me my fa- -ther!
Calm- -ly good Laertes
That drop of blood that's calm pro- -claims me bas- -tard
Cries cuck- -old to my fa- -ther brands the har- -lot
Even here be- -tween the chaste un- -smirched brow
Of my true moth- -er
What is the cause Laertes
That thy re- -bel- -lion looks so gi- -ant- -- -like?
Let him go Gertrude do not fear our per- -son
There's such di- -vin- -i- -ty doth hedge a king
That trea- -son can but peep to what it would
Acts lit- -tle of his will. ell me Laertes
Why thou art thus in- -cen- -s'd. et him go Gertrude
Speak man
Where is my fa- -ther?
But not by him
Let him de- -mand his fill
How came he dead? I'll not be jug- -gled with
To hell al- -le- -giance! vows to the black- -est dev- -il!
Con- -science and grace to the pro- -found- -est pit!
I dare damna- -tion: o this point I stand
That both the worlds I give to neg- -li- -gence
Let come what comes on- -ly I'll be re- -veng'd
Most through- -ly for my fa- -ther
Who shall stay you?
My will not all the world
And for my means I'll hus- -band them so well
They shall go far with lit- -tle
Good Laertes
If you de- -sire to know the cer- -tain- -ty
Of your dear fa- -ther's death is't writ in your re- -venge
That sweep- -stake you will draw both friend and foe
Win- -ner and loser?
None but his en- -e- -mies
Will you know them then?
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
And like the kind life- -ren- -der- -ing pel- -i- -can
Repast them with my blood
Why now you speak
Like a good child and a true gen- -tle- -man
That I am guilt- -less of your fa- -ther's death
And am most sen- -si- -bly in grief for it
It shall as lev- -el to your judg- -ment pierce
As day does to your eye
How now! What noise is that?
O heat dry up my brain- -s! tears sev- -en times salt
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heav- -en thy mad- -ness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May!
Dear maid kind sis- -ter sweet Ophe- -li- -a!
O heav- -en- -s! is't pos- -si- -ble a young maid- -'s wits
Should be as mor- -tal as an old man's life?
Na- -ture is fine in love and where 'tis fine
It sends some pre- -cious in- -stance of it- -self
Af- -ter the thing it loves
They bore him barefac'd on the bier
Hey no non- -ny non- -ny hey non- -ny
And on his grave rain'd many a tear
Fare you well my dove!
Hadst thou thy wits and didst per- -suade re- -venge
It could not move thus
You must sing 'Down a- -- -down an you call him a- -- -down- -a.' O
how the wheel be- -comes it! It is the false stew- -ard that stole his
mas- -ter's daugh- -ter
This noth- -ing's more than mat- -ter
There's rose- -mary that's for re- -mem- -brance pray love
re- -mem- -ber and there is pan- -sies that's for thoughts
A doc- -u- -ment in mad- -ness, houghts and re- -mem- -brance fit- -ted
There's fen- -nel for you and columbi- -nes: here's rue for you
and here's some for me: e may call it herb of grace o'
Sun- -days: you must wear your rue with a dif- -fer- -ence. here's a
daisy: would give you some vi- -o- -lets but they with- -er'd all when
my fa- -ther died: hey say he made a good end
For bon- -ny sweet Robin is all my joy
Thought and af- -flic- -tion pas- -sion hell it- -self
She turns to favour and to pret- -ti- -ness
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No no he is dead
Go to thy death- -bed
He nev- -er will come again
His beard was as white as snow
All flax- -en was his poll
He is gone he is gone
And we cast away moan
God ha' mer- -cy on his soul!
And of all Chris- -tian souls I pray God. od b' wi' ye
Do you see this O God?
Laertes I must com- -mune with your grief
Or you de- -ny me right Go but apart
Make choice of whom your wis- -est friends you will
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me
If by di- -rect or by col- -lat- -er- -al hand
They find us touch'd we will our king- -dom give
Our crown our life and all that we call ours
To you in sat- -is- -fac- -tion but if not
Be you con- -tent to lend your pa- -tience to us
And we shall joint- -ly labour with your soul
To give it due con- -tent
Let this be so
His means of death his ob- -scure buri- -al
No tro- -phy sword nor hatch- -ment o'er his bones
No no- -ble rite nor for- -mal os- -ten- -ta- -tion
Cry to be heard as 'twere from heav- -en to earth
That I must cal- -l't in ques- -tion
So you shall
And where the of- -fence is let the great axe fall
I pray you go with me
What are they that would speak with me?
Sailors sir they say they have let- -ters for you
Let them come in
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greet- -ed if not from Lord Ham- -let
I Sailor
God bless you sir
Let him bless thee too
He shall sir an't please him There's a let- -ter for you
sir, t comes from the am- -bas- -sador that was bound for Eng- -land if
your name be Ho- -r- -a- -tio as I am let to know it is
this give these fel- -lows some means to the king they have
let- -ters for him Ere we were two days old at sea a pi- -rate of
very war- -like ap- -point- -ment gave us chase Find- -ing our- -selves too
slow of sail we put on a com- -pelled val- -our and in the grap- -ple I
board- -ed them on the in- -stant they got clear of our ship so I
alone be- -came their pris- -on- -er They have dealt with me like thieves
of mer- -cy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for
them Let the king have the let- -ters I have sent and re- -pair thou
to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death I have words
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too
light for the bore of the mat- -ter These good fel- -lows will bring
thee where I am Rosen- -crantz and Guilden- -stern hold their course
for Eng- -land of them I have much to tell thee Farewell
He that thou know- -est thine HAM- -LET.'
Come I will give you way for these your let- -ters
And do't the speed- -i- -er that you may di- -rect me
To him from whom you brought them
Now must your con- -science my ac- -quit- -tance seal
And you must put me in your heart for friend
Sith you have heard and with a know- -ing ear
That he which hath your no- -ble fa- -ther slain
Pur- -su'd my life
It well ap- -pears: ut tell me
Why you pro- -ceed- -ed not against these feats
So crime- -ful and so cap- -i- -tal in na- -ture
As by your safe- -ty wis- -dom all things else
You main- -ly were stir- -r'd up
O for two spe- -cial rea- -sons
Which may to you per- -haps seem much un- -sinew'd
But yet to me they are strong The queen his moth- -er
Lives al- -most by his looks and for my- -self
My virtue or my plague be it ei- -ther which
She's so con- -junc- -tive to my life and soul
That as the star moves not but in his sphere
I could not but by her The oth- -er mo- -tive
Why to a pub- -lic count I might not go
Is the great love the gen- -er- -al gen- -der bear him
Who dip- -ping all his faults in their af- -fec- -tion
Would like the spring that tur- -neth wood to stone
Con- -vert his gyves to graces so that my ar- -rows
Too slight- -ly tim- -ber'd for so loud a wind
Would have re- -vert- -ed to my bow again
And not where I had aim'd them
And so have I a no- -ble fa- -ther lost
A sis- -ter driv- -en in- -to des- -per- -ate terms
Whose worth if prais- -es may go back again
Stood chal- -lenger on mount of all the age
For her per- -fec- -tion- -s: ut my re- -venge will come
Break not your sleeps for that: ou must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with dan- -ger
And think it pas- -time You short- -ly shall hear more
I lov'd your fa- -ther and we love our- -self
And that I hope will teach you to imag- -ine
How now! What news?
Let- -ters my lord from Ham- -let
This to your majesty this to the queen
From Ham- -let! Who brought them?
Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
They were giv- -en me by Clau- -dio: e re- -ceiv'd them
Of him that brought them
Laertes you shall hear them
Leave us
king- -dom To- -- -mor- -row shall I beg leave to see your king- -ly eyes
when I shall first ask- -ing your par- -don there- -un- -to re- -count the
oc- -ca- -sions of my sud- -den and more strange re- -turn HAM- -LET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse and no such thing?
Know you the hand?
'Tis Ham- -let's char- -ac- -ter: Naked!'
And in a post- -script here he says 'alone.'
Can you ad- -vise me?
I am lost in it my lord But let him come
It warms the very sick- -ness in my heart
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
'Thus didest thou.'
If it be so Laertes
As how should it be so? how oth- -er- -wise?
Will you be rul'd by me?
Ay my lord
So you will not o'er- -rule me to a peace
To thine own peace If he be now re- -turn'd
As check- -ing at his voy- -age and that he means
No more to un- -der- -take it, will work him
To ex- -ploit now ripe in my de- -vice
Un- -der the which he shall not choose but fall
And for his death no wind shall breathe
But even his moth- -er shall un- -charge the prac- -tice
And call it ac- -ci- -dent
My lord I will be rul'd
The rather if you could de- -vise it so
That I might be the or- -gan
It falls right
You have been talk'd of since your trav- -el much
And that in Ham- -let's hear- -ing for a qual- -i- -ty
Where- -in they say you shine your sum of parts
Did not to- -geth- -er pluck such en- -vy from him
As did that one and that in my re- -gard
Of the un- -wor- -thi- -est siege
What part is that my lord?
A very riband in the cap of youth
Yet need- -ful too for youth no less be- -comes
The light and care- -less liv- -ery that it wears
Than set- -tled age his sables and his weeds
Im- -port- -ing health and grave- -ness. wo months since
Here was a gen- -tle- -man of Nor- -mandy
I've seen my- -self and serv'd against the French
And they can well on horse- -back but this gal- -lant
Had witch- -craft in- -'t he grew un- -to his seat
And to such won- -drous do- -ing brought his horse
As had he been in- -corp- -s'd and demi- -- -natur'd
With the brave beast so far he top- -p'd my thought
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did
A Nor- -man was't?
A Nor- -man
Up- -on my life La- -m- -ond
The very same
I know him well he is the brooch in- -deed
And gem of all the na- -tion
He made con- -fes- -sion of you
And gave you such a mas- -ter- -ly re- -port
For art and ex- -er- -cise in your de- -fence
And for your rapi- -er most es- -pe- -cial- -ly
That he cried out 't- -would be a sight in- -deed
If one could match you the scrimers of their na- -tion
He swore had nei- -ther mo- -tion guard nor eye
If you op- -pos'd them Sir this re- -port of his
Did Ham- -let so en- -ven- -om with his en- -vy
That he could noth- -ing do but wish and beg
Your sud- -den com- -ing o'er to play with him
Now out of this
What out of this my lord?
Laertes was your fa- -ther dear to you?
Or are you like the paint- -ing of a sor- -row
A face with- -out a heart?
Why ask you this?
Not that I think you did not love your fa- -ther
But that I know love is be- -gun by time
And that I see in pas- -sages of proof
Time qual- -i- -fies the spark and fire of it
There lives with- -in the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
And noth- -ing is at a like good- -ness still
For good- -ness grow- -ing to a plurisy
Dies in his own too much that we would do
We should do when we would for this 'would' changes
And hath abate- -ments and de- -lays as many
As there are tongues are hands are ac- -ci- -dents
And then this 'should' is like a spend- -thrift sigh
That hurts by eas- -ing But to the quick o' the ul- -cer
Ham- -let comes back what would you un- -der- -take
To show your- -self your fa- -ther's son in deed
More than in word- -s?
To cut his throat i' the church
No place in- -deed should mur- -der sanc- -tu- -ar- -ize
Re- -venge should have no bounds But good Laertes
Will you do this keep close with- -in your cham- -ber
Ham- -let re- -turn'd shall know you are come home
We'll put on those shall praise your ex- -cel- -lence
And set a dou- -ble var- -nish on the fame
The French- -man gave you bring you in fine to- -geth- -er
And wa- -ger on your heads he be- -ing re- -miss
Most gen- -er- -ous and free from all con- -triv- -ing
Will not pe- -ruse the foils so that with ease
Or with a lit- -tle shuf- -fling you may choose
A sword un- -bat- -ed and in a pass of prac- -tice
Re- -quite him for your fa- -ther
I will do't
And for that pur- -pose I'll anoint my sword
I bought an unc- -tion of a moun- -te- -bank
So mor- -tal that but dip a knife in it
Where it draws blood no cat- -a- -plasm so rare
Col- -lect- -ed from all sim- -ples that have virtue
Un- -der the moon can save the thing from death
This is but scratch'd with- -al I'll touch my point
With this con- -ta- -gion that if I gall him slight- -ly
It may be death
Let's fur- -ther think of this
Weigh what con- -ve- -nience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape if this should fail
And that our drift look through our bad per- -for- -mance
'Twere bet- -ter not as- -say'd there- -fore this project
Should have a back or sec- -ond that might hold
If this did blast in proof Soft! let me see
We'll make a solemn wa- -ger on your cun- -nings
I ha't
When in your mo- -tion you are hot and dry
As make your bouts more vi- -o- -lent to that end
And that he calls for drink I'll have prepar'd him
A chal- -ice for the nonce where- -on but sip- -ping
If he by chance es- -cape your ven- -om'd stuck
Our pur- -pose may hold there
How now sweet queen!
One woe doth tread up- -on an- -oth- -er's heel
So fast they fol- -low: our sis- -ter's drown'd Laertes
Drown'd! O where?
There is a wil- -low grows aslant a brook
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
There with fan- -tas- -tic gar- -lands did she come
Of crowflow- -ers net- -tles daisies and long pur- -ples
That lib- -er- -al shep- -herds give a gross- -er name
But our cold maids do dead men's fin- -gers call them
There on the pen- -dant boughs her coro- -net weeds
Clam- -b'ring to hang an en- -vi- -ous sliv- -er broke
When down her weedy tro- -phies and her- -self
Fell in the weep- -ing brook Her clothes spread wide
And mer- -maid- -- -- -like awhile they bore her up
Which time she chaunt- -ed snatch- -es of old tunes
As one in- -ca- -pable of her own dis- -tress
Or like a crea- -ture na- -tive and in- -du'd
Un- -to that el- -e- -ment but long it could not be
Till that her gar- -ments heavy with their drink
Pul- -l'd the poor wretch from her melo- -di- -ous lay
To mud- -dy death
Alas then she is drown'd?
Drown'd drown'd
Too much of wa- -ter hast thou poor Ophe- -lia
And there- -fore I for- -bid my tears but yet
It is our trick na- -ture her cus- -tom holds
Let shame say what it will when these are gone
The wom- -an will be out. dieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
But that this fol- -ly douts it
Let's fol- -low Gertrude
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again
There- -fore let's fol- -low
Is she to be buried in Chris- -tian buri- -al when she wil- -ful- -ly
seeks her own sal- -va- -tion?
I tell thee she is and there- -fore make her grave straight the
crown- -er hath sat on her and finds it Chris- -tian buri- -al
How can that be un- -less she drowned her- -self in her own de- -fence?
Why 'tis found so
It must be se of- -fend- -en- -do it can- -not be else For here lies
the point if I drown my- -self wit- -ting- -ly it ar- -gues an act and an
act hath three branch- -es it is to act to do and to per- -form
ar- -gal she drowned her- -self wit- -ting- -ly
Nay but hear you good- -man delver
Give me leave Here lies the wa- -ter good here stands the
man good if the man go to this wa- -ter and drown him- -self it is
will he nill he he goes, ark you that but if the wa- -ter come
to him and drown him he drowns not him- -self ar- -gal he that is
not guilty of his own death short- -ens not his own life
But is this law?
Ay mar- -ry is't rown- -er's quest law
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
gen- -tle- -wom- -an she should have been buried out o' Chris- -tian buri- -al
Why there thou say'st and the more pity that great folk
should have coun- -te- -nance in this world to drown or hang them- -selves
more than their even Chris- -tian. ome my spade There is no
an- -cient gen- -tle- -men but gar- -den- -ers ditch- -ers and grave- -- -mak- -ers they
hold up Adam's pro- -fes- -sion
Was he a gen- -tle- -man?
He was the first that ev- -er bore arms
Why he had none
What art a hea- -then? How dost thou un- -der- -stand the Scrip- -ture?
The Scrip- -ture says Adam dig- -g'd could he dig with- -out arm- -s? I'll
put an- -oth- -er ques- -tion to thee if thou an- -swer- -est me not to the
pur- -pose con- -fess thy- -self
Go to
What is he that builds stronger than ei- -ther the ma- -son the
ship- -wright or the car- -pen- -ter?
The gal- -lows- -- -mak- -er for that frame out- -lives a thou- -sand ten- -ants
I like thy wit well in good faith the gal- -lows does well
but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill now
thou dost ill to say the gal- -lows is built stronger than the
church ar- -gal the gal- -lows may do well to thee To't again come
Who builds stronger than a ma- -son a ship- -wright or a car- -pen- -ter?
Ay tell me that and un- -yoke
Mar- -ry now I can tell
To't
Mass I can- -not tell
Cud- -gel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will
not mend his pace with beat- -ing and when you are asked this
ques- -tion next say 'a grave- -- -mak- -er;' the hous- -es he makes last
till dooms- -day Go get thee to Yaugh- -an fetch me a stoup of
liquor
In youth when I did love did love
Methought it was very sweet
To con- -tract O the time for ah my be- -hove
O methought there was noth- -ing meet
Has this fel- -low no feel- -ing of his busi- -ness that he sings at
grave- -- -mak- -ing?
Cus- -tom hath made it in him a prop- -er- -ty of eas- -i- -ness
'Tis e'en so the hand of lit- -tle em- -ploy- -ment hath the dain- -tier
sense
But age with his steal- -ing steps
Hath claw'd me in his clutch
And hath ship- -p'd me in- -to the land
As if I had nev- -er been such
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once how the
knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jaw- -bone that
did the first mur- -der! This might be the pate of a politi- -cian
which this ass now o'er- -reach- -es one that would cir- -cum- -vent God
might it not?
It might my lord
Or of a courtier which could say 'Good mor- -row sweet lord!
How dost thou good lord?' This might be my lord such- -a- -one that
praised my lord such- -a- -one's horse when he meant to beg
it, ight it not?
Ay my lord
Why e'en so and now my La- -dy Wor- -m's chap- -less and knocked
about the mazard with a sex- -ton's spade here's fine rev- -o- -lu- -tion
an we had the trick to see't Did these bones cost no more the
breed- -ing but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think
on't
A pick- -axe and a spade a spade
For and a shroud- -ing sheet
O a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
There's an- -oth- -er why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quid- -dits now his quil- -lets his cas- -es his tenures
and his trick- -s? why does he suf- -fer this rude knave now to knock
him about the sconce with a dirty shov- -el and will not tell him
of his ac- -tion of bat- -tery? Hum! This fel- -low might be in- -'s time a
great buy- -er of land with his statutes his rec- -og- -nizances his
fines his dou- -ble vouch- -ers his re- -cov- -er- -ies is this the fine of
his fines and the re- -cov- -ery of his re- -cov- -er- -ies to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouch- -ers vouch him no more of
his pur- -chas- -es and dou- -ble ones too than the length and breadth
of a pair of in- -den- -tures? The very con- -veyances of his lands will
scarce- -ly lie in this box and must the in- -her- -i- -tor him- -self have no
more ha?
Not a jot more my lord
Is not parch- -ment made of sheep- -- -skin- -s?
Ay my lord And of calf- -skins too
They are sheep and calves which seek out as- -sur- -ance in that I
will speak to this fel- -low. hose grave's this sir?
Mine sir
O a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
I think it be thine in- -deed for thou li- -est in- -'t
You lie out on't sir and there- -fore 'tis not yours for my part
I do not lie in- -'t yet it is mine
Thou dost lie in- -'t to be in- -'t and say it is thine 'tis for
the dead not for the quick there- -fore thou li- -est
'Tis a quick lie sir 't will away again from me to you
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man sir
What wom- -an then?
For none nei- -ther
Who is to be buried in- -'t?
One that was a wom- -an sir but rest her soul she's dead
How ab- -so- -lute the knave is! We must speak by the card or
equiv- -o- -ca- -tion will un- -do us By the Lord Ho- -r- -a- -tio these three
years I have tak- -en note of it the age is grown so picked that
the toe of the peas- -ant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
galls his kibe. ow long hast thou been a grave- -- -mak- -er?
Of all the days i' the year I came to't that day that our
last King Ham- -let over- -came Fort- -in- -bras
How long is that since?
Can- -not you tell that? ev- -ery fool can tell that it was the
very day that young Ham- -let was born, e that is mad and sent
in- -to Eng- -land
Ay mar- -ry why was be sent in- -to Eng- -land?
Why be- -cause he was mad he shall re- -cov- -er his wits there
or if he do not it's no great mat- -ter there
Why?
'Twill not he seen in him there there the men are as mad as he
How came he mad?
Very strange- -ly they say
How strange- -ly?
Faith e'en with los- -ing his wits
Up- -on what ground?
Why here in Den- -mark I have been sex- -ton here man and boy
thir- -ty years
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
Faith if he be not rot- -ten be- -fore he die, s we have many
pocky cors- -es now- -a- -- -days that will scarce hold the lay- -ing in, e
will last you some eight year or nine year a tan- -ner will last
you nine year
Why he more than an- -oth- -er?
Why sir his hide is so tan- -n'd with his trade that he will
keep out wa- -ter a great while and your wa- -ter is a sore de- -cay- -er of
your whore- -son dead body Here's a skull now this skull hath lain
in the earth three- -- -and- -twen- -ty years
Whose was it?
A whore- -son mad fel- -low's it was whose do you think it was?
Nay I know not
A pesti- -lence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
Rhen- -ish on my head once This same skull sir was Yorick- -'s
skull the king's jester
This?
E'en that
Let me see [Takes the skul- -l.] Alas poor Yorick! knew him
Ho- -r- -a- -tio a fel- -low of in- -fi- -nite jest of most ex- -cel- -lent fan- -cy he
hath borne me on his back a thou- -sand times and now how ab- -horred
in my imag- -i- -na- -tion it is! my gorge ris- -es at it Here hung those
lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft Where be your gibes
now? your gam- -bol- -s? your songs? your flash- -es of mer- -ri- -ment that
were wont to set the ta- -ble on a roar? Not one now to mock your
own grin- -ning? quite chap- -- -fal- -l- -en? Now get you to my la- -dy's
cham- -ber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this
favour she must come make her laugh at that. r'ythee Ho- -r- -a- -tio
tell me one thing
What's that my lord?
Dost thou think Alexan- -der looked o' this fash- -ion i' the earth?
E'en so
And smelt so? Pah!
E'en so my lord
To what base us- -es we may re- -turn Ho- -r- -a- -tio! Why may not
imag- -i- -na- -tion trace the no- -ble dust of Alexan- -der till he find it
stop- -ping a bung- -- -hole?
'Twere to con- -sid- -er too cu- -ri- -ous- -ly to con- -sid- -er so
No faith not a jot but to fol- -low him thith- -er with mod- -esty
enough and like- -li- -hood to lead it as thus Alexan- -der died
Alexan- -der was buried Alexan- -der re- -tur- -neth in- -to dust the dust is
earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam where- -to he
was con- -vert- -ed might they not stop a beer- -bar- -rel?
Im- -pe- -ri- -ous Cae- -sar dead and turn'd to clay
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
Should patch a wall to ex- -pel the win- -ter's flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside! ere comes the king
The queen the courtiers who is that they fol- -low?
And with such maimed rites? This doth be- -to- -ken
The corse they fol- -low did with des- -per- -ate hand
For- -do it own life 't- -was of some es- -tate
Couch we awhile and mark
What cer- -e- -mo- -ny else?
That is Laertes
A very no- -ble youth mark
What cer- -e- -mo- -ny else?
Her ob- -se- -quies have been as far en- -larg'd
As we have war- -ranties her death was doubt- -ful
And but that great com- -mand o'er- -sways the or- -der
She should in ground un- -sanc- -ti- -fied have lodg'd
Till the last trum- -pet for char- -i- -ta- -ble prayers
Shards flints and peb- -bles should be thrown on her
Yet here she is al- -lowed her vir- -gin rites
Her maid- -en strew- -ments and the bring- -ing home
Of bell and buri- -al
Must there no more be done?
No more be done
We should pro- -fane the ser- -vice of the dead
To sing a re- -quiem and such rest to her
As to peace- -- -part- -ed souls
Lay her i' the earth
And from her fair and un- -pol- -lut- -ed flesh
May vi- -o- -lets spring! tell thee churl- -ish priest
A min- -is- -ter- -ing an- -gel shall my sis- -ter be
When thou li- -est howl- -ing
What the fair Ophe- -li- -a?
Sweets to the sweet farewell
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Ham- -let's wife
I thought thy bride- -bed to have deck- -'d sweet maid
And not have strew'd thy grave
O tre- -ble woe
Fall ten times tre- -ble on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed thy most in- -ge- -nious sense
De- -priv'd thee of! old off the earth awhile
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Now pile your dust up- -on the quick and dead
Till of this flat a moun- -tain you have made
To o'er- -top old Pe- -lion or the sky- -ish head
Of blue Olym- -pus
What is he whose grief
Bears such an em- -pha- -sis? whose phrase of sor- -row
Con- -jures the wan- -der- -ing stars and makes them stand
Like won- -der- -- -wound- -ed hear- -ers? this is I
Ham- -let the Dane
The dev- -il take thy soul!
Thou pray'st not well
I pr'ythee take thy fin- -gers from my throat
For though I am not splene- -tive and rash
Yet have I in me some- -thing dan- -ger- -ous
Which let thy wise- -ness fear away thy hand!
Pluck them asun- -der
Ham- -let! Ham- -let!
Gen- -tle- -men!
Good my lord be qui- -et
Why I will fight with him up- -on this theme
Un- -til my eye- -lids will no longer wag
O my son what the- -me?
I lov'd Ophe- -lia forty thou- -sand broth- -ers
Could not with all their quan- -ti- -ty of love
Make up my sum. hat wilt thou do for her?
O he is mad Laertes
For love of God for- -bear him!
'S- -wounds show me what thou'lt do
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thy- -self?
Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. ost thou come here to whine?
To out- -face me with leap- -ing in her grave?
Be buried quick with her and so will I
And if thou prate of moun- -tains let them throw
Mil- -lions of acres on us till our ground
Singe- -ing his pate against the burn- -ing zone
Make Os- -sa like a wart! Nay an thou'lt mouth
I'll rant as well as thou
This is mere mad- -ness
And thus a while the fit will work on him
Anon as pa- -tient as the fe- -male dove
When that her gold- -en cou- -plets are dis- -clos'd
His si- -lence will sit droop- -ing
Hear you sir
What is the rea- -son that you use me thus?
I lov'd you ev- -er but it is no mat- -ter
Let Her- -cules him- -self do what he may
The cat will mew and dog will have his day
I pray thee good Ho- -r- -a- -tio wait up- -on him
Strength- -en your pa- -tience in our last night's speech
We'll put the mat- -ter to the present push
Good Gertrude set some watch over your son
This grave shall have a liv- -ing mon- -u- -ment
An hour of qui- -et short- -ly shall we see
Till then in pa- -tience our pro- -ceed- -ing be
So much for this sir now let me see the oth- -er
You do re- -mem- -ber all the cir- -cum- -stance?
Re- -mem- -ber it my lord!
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fight- -ing
That would not let me sleep methought I lay
Worse than the mu- -tinies in the bil- -boes Rash- -ly
And prais'd be rash- -ness for it, et us know
Our in- -dis- -cre- -tion some- -time serves us well
When our deep plots do fail and that should teach us
There's a di- -vin- -i- -ty that shapes our ends
Rough- -hew them how we will
That is most cer- -tain
Up from my cab- -in
My sea- -- -gown scar- -f'd about me in the dark
Grop'd I to find out them had my de- -sire
Fin- -ger'd their pack- -et and in fine with- -drew
To mine own room again mak- -ing so bold
My fears for- -get- -ting man- -ners to un- -seal
Their grand com- -mis- -sion where I found Ho- -r- -a- -tio
O roy- -al knav- -ery! an ex- -act com- -mand
Lard- -ed with many sev- -er- -al sorts of rea- -sons
Im- -port- -ing Den- -mark's health and Eng- -land's too
With ho! such bugs and gob- -lins in my life
That on the su- -per- -vise no leisure bat- -ed
No not to stay the grind- -ing of the axe
My head should be struck off
Is't pos- -si- -ble?
Here's the com- -mis- -sion read it at more leisure
But wilt thou bear me how I did pro- -ceed?
I be- -seech you
Be- -ing thus benet- -ted round with vil- -la- -nies
Or I could make a pro- -logue to my brains
They had be- -gun the play, sat me down
De- -vis'd a new com- -mis- -sion wrote it fair
I once did hold it as our statists do
A base- -ness to write fair and labour'd much
How to for- -get that learn- -ing but sir now
It did me yeo- -man's ser- -vice Wilt thou know
The ef- -fect of what I wrote?
Ay good my lord
An earnest con- -ju- -ra- -tion from the king
As Eng- -land was his faith- -ful trib- -u- -tary
As love be- -tween them like the palm might flour- -ish
As peace should still her wheat- -en gar- -land wear
And stand a com- -ma 'tween their ami- -ties
And many such- -- -like as's of great charge
That on the view and know of these con- -tents
With- -out de- -bate- -ment fur- -ther more or less
He should the bear- -ers put to sud- -den death
Not shriv- -ing- -- -time al- -low'd
How was this seal'd?
Why even in that was heav- -en or- -di- -nant
I had my fa- -ther's signet in my purse
Which was the mod- -el of that Dan- -ish seal
Fold- -ed the writ up in the form of the oth- -er
Sub- -scrib'd it gave't the im- -pres- -sion plac'd it safe- -ly
The changeling nev- -er known Now the next day
Was our sea- -- -fight and what to this was se- -quent
Thou know'st al- -ready
So Guilden- -stern and Rosen- -crantz go to't
Why man they did make love to this em- -ploy- -ment
They are not near my con- -science their de- -feat
Does by their own in- -sin- -u- -a- -tion grow
'Tis dan- -ger- -ous when the baser na- -ture comes
Be- -tween the pass and fell in- -censed points
Of mighty op- -po- -sites
Why what a king is this!
Does it not thinks't thee stand me now up- -on
He that hath kil- -l'd my king and whor'd my moth- -er
Pop- -p'd in be- -tween the elec- -tion and my hopes
Thrown out his an- -gle for my prop- -er life
And with such coz- -enage s't not per- -fect con- -science
To quit him with this ar- -m? and is't not to be damn'd
To let this canker of our na- -ture come
In fur- -ther evil?
It must be short- -ly known to him from Eng- -land
What is the is- -sue of the busi- -ness there
It will be short the in- -ter- -im is mine
And a man's life is no more than to say One
But I am very sor- -ry good Ho- -r- -a- -tio
That to Laertes I for- -got my- -self
For by the im- -age of my cause I see
The por- -trai- -ture of his I'll court his favours
But sure the brav- -ery of his grief did put me
In- -to a tow- -er- -ing pas- -sion
Peace who comes here?
Your lord- -ship is right wel- -come back to Den- -mark
I humbly thank you sir Dost know this wa- -ter- -fly?
No my good lord
Thy state is the more gra- -cious for 'tis a vice to know him He
hath much land and fer- -tile let a beast be lord of beasts and
his crib shall stand at the king's mess 'tis a chough but as I
say spa- -cious in the pos- -ses- -sion of dirt
Sweet lord if your lord- -ship were at leisure I should
im- -part a thing to you from his majesty
I will re- -ceive it with all dili- -gence of spir- -it Put your
bon- -net to his right use 'tis for the head
I thank your lord- -ship t'is very hot
No be- -lieve me 'tis very cold the wind is norther- -ly
It is in- -dif- -fer- -ent cold my lord in- -deed
Me- -thinks it is very sul- -try and hot for my com- -plex- -ion
Ex- -ceed- -ing- -ly my lord it is very sul- -try, s 'twere can- -not
tell how But my lord his majesty bade me sig- -ni- -fy to you that
he has laid a great wa- -ger on your head Sir this is the
mat- -ter
I be- -seech you re- -mem- -ber
Nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith Sir here
is new- -ly come to court Laertes be- -lieve me an ab- -so- -lute
gen- -tle- -man full of most ex- -cel- -lent dif- -fer- -ences of very soft
so- -ci- -ety and great show- -ing in- -deed to speak feel- -ing- -ly of him he
is the card or cal- -en- -dar of gen- -try for you shall find in him the
con- -ti- -nent of what part a gen- -tle- -man would see
Sir his de- -fine- -ment suf- -fers no perdi- -tion in you; hough I
know to di- -vide him in- -ven- -to- -ri- -al- -ly would dizzy the arith- -metic of
mem- -o- -ry and yet but yaw nei- -ther in re- -spect of his quick sail
But in the ver- -i- -ty of ex- -tol- -ment I take him to be a soul of great
ar- -ti- -cle and his in- -fu- -sion of such dearth and rareness as to make
true dic- -tion of him his sem- -blable is his mir- -ror and who else
would trace him his um- -brage noth- -ing more
Your lord- -ship speaks most in- -fal- -li- -bly of him
The con- -cer- -nan- -cy sir? why do we wrap the gen- -tle- -man in our more
raw- -er breath?
Sir?
Is't not pos- -si- -ble to un- -der- -stand in an- -oth- -er tongue? You will do't
sir re- -al- -ly
What im- -ports the nom- -i- -na- -tion of this gen- -tle- -man?
Of Laertes?
His purse is emp- -ty al- -ready al- -l's gold- -en words are spent
Of him sir
I know you are not ig- -no- -rant
I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
much ap- -prove me. ell sir
You are not ig- -no- -rant of what ex- -cel- -lence Laertes is
I dare not con- -fess that lest I should com- -pare with him in
ex- -cel- -lence but to know a man well were to know him- -self
I mean sir for his weapon but in the im- -pu- -ta- -tion laid on
him by them in his meed he's un- -fel- -lowed
What's his weapon?
Rapi- -er and dag- -ger
That's two of his weapon- -s: ut well
The king sir hath wa- -ger'd with him six Bar- -bary hors- -es
against the which he has im- -poned as I take it six French
rapiers and poniards with their as- -signs as gir- -dle hang- -ers and
so three of the car- -riages in faith are very dear to fan- -cy
very re- -spon- -sive to the hilts most del- -i- -cate car- -riages and of
very lib- -er- -al con- -ceit
What call you the car- -riages?
I knew you must be ed- -i- -fied by the mar- -gent ere you had done
The car- -riages sir are the hang- -ers
The phrase would be more ger- -man to the mat- -ter if we could
car- -ry can- -non by our sides I would it might be hang- -ers till then
But on six Bar- -bary hors- -es against six French swords their
as- -signs and three lib- -er- -al con- -ceit- -ed car- -riages that's the French
bet against the Dan- -ish why is this all im- -poned as you call it?
The king sir hath laid that in a dozen pass- -es be- -tween
your and him he shall not ex- -ceed you three hits he hath
laid on twelve for nine and it would come to im- -me- -di- -ate tri- -al
if your lord- -ship would vouch- -safe the an- -swer
How if I an- -swer no?
I mean my lord the op- -po- -si- -tion of your per- -son in tri- -al
Sir I will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
it is the breath- -ing time of day with me let the foils be
brought the gen- -tle- -man will- -ing and the king hold his pur- -pose
I will win for him if I can if not I will gain noth- -ing but my
shame and the odd hits
Shall I re- -de- -liv- -er you e'en so?
To this ef- -fect sir af- -ter what flour- -ish your na- -ture will
I com- -mend my du- -ty to your lord- -ship
Yours yours
He does well to com- -mend it him- -self there are no tongues else
for's turn
This lap- -wing runs away with the shell on his head
He did com- -ply with his dug be- -fore he suck- -'d it Thus has he, nd
many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on
on- -ly got the tune of the time and out- -ward habit of en- -counter
a kind of yesty col- -lec- -tion which car- -ries them through and
through the most fanned and win- -nowed opin- -ions and do but blow
them to their tri- -al the bub- -bles are out
My lord his majesty com- -mend- -ed him to you by young Os- -ric
who brings back to him that you at- -tend him in the hall he sends
to know if your plea- -sure hold to play with Laertes or that you
will take longer time
I am con- -stant to my pur- -pos- -es they fol- -low the king's plea- -sure
if his fit- -ness speaks mine is ready now or when- -so- -ev- -er pro- -vid- -ed
I be so able as now
The King and Queen and all are com- -ing down
In hap- -py time
The queen de- -sires you to use some gen- -tle en- -ter- -tain- -ment to
Laertes be- -fore you fall to play
She well in- -structs me
You will lose this wa- -ger my lord
I do not think so since he went in- -to France I have been in
con- -tin- -u- -al prac- -tice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not
think how ill al- -l's here about my heart but it is no mat- -ter
Nay good my lord
It is but fool- -ery but it is such a kind of gain- -- -giv- -ing as
would per- -haps trou- -ble a wom- -an
If your mind dis- -like any- -thing obey it I will fore- -stall their
re- -pair hith- -er and say you are not fit
Not a whit we de- -fy au- -gury there's a spe- -cial prov- -i- -dence in
the fall of a spar- -row If it be now 'tis not to come if it be
not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
the readi- -ness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves
what is't to leave be- -times?
Come Ham- -let come and take this hand from me
Give me your par- -don sir I have done you wrong
But par- -don't as you are a gen- -tle- -man
This pres- -ence knows and you must needs have heard
How I am pun- -ish'd with sore dis- -trac- -tion
What I have done
That might your na- -ture hon- -our and ex- -cep- -tion
Rough- -ly awake I here pro- -claim was mad- -ness
Was't Ham- -let wrong'd Laertes? Nev- -er Ham- -let
If Ham- -let from him- -self be ta'en away
And when he's not him- -self does wrong Laertes
Then Ham- -let does it not Ham- -let de- -nies it
Who does it then? His mad- -ness if't be so
Ham- -let is of the fac- -tion that is wrong'd
His mad- -ness is poor Ham- -let's en- -e- -my
Sir in this au- -di- -ence
Let my dis- -claim- -ing from a pur- -pos'd evil
Free me so far in your most gen- -er- -ous thoughts
That I have shot my ar- -row o'er the house
And hurt my broth- -er
I am sat- -is- -fied in na- -ture
Whose mo- -tive in this case should stir me most
To my re- -venge But in my terms of hon- -our
I stand aloof and will no rec- -on- -cile- -ment
Till by some el- -der mas- -ters of known hon- -our
I have a voice and prece- -dent of peace
To keep my name un- -gor'd But till that time
I do re- -ceive your of- -fer- -'d love like love
And will not wrong it
I em- -brace it freely
And will this broth- -er's wa- -ger frankly play
Give us the foils come on
Come one for me
I'll be your foil Laertes in mine ig- -no- -rance
Your skill shall like a star in the dark- -est night
Stick fiery off in- -deed
You mock me sir
No by this hand
Give them the foils young Os- -ric Cousin Ham- -let
You know the wa- -ger?
Very well my lord
Your grace has laid the odds o' the weak- -er side
I do not fear it I have seen you both
But since he's bet- -ter'd we have there- -fore odds
This is too heavy let me see an- -oth- -er
This likes me well These foils have all a length?
Ay my good lord
Set me the stoups of wine up- -on that ta- -ble
If Ham- -let give the first or sec- -ond hit
Or quit in an- -swer of the third ex- -change
Let all the bat- -tle- -ments their ord- -nance fire
The king shall drink to Ham- -let's bet- -ter breath
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Rich- -er than that which four suc- -ces- -sive kings
In Den- -mark's crown have worn Give me the cups
And let the ket- -tle to the trum- -pet speak
The trum- -pet to the can- -noneer with- -out
The can- -nons to the heav- -ens the heav- -ens to earth
'Now the king drinks to Ham- -let.' ome be- -gin
And you the judges bear a wary eye
Come on sir
Come my lord
Judg- -men- -t!
A hit a very pal- -pa- -ble hit
Well; gain
Stay give me drink. am- -let this pearl is thine
Here's to thy health
Give him the cup
I'll play this bout first set it by awhile
Come. nother hit what say you?
A touch a touch I do con- -fess
Our son shall win
He's fat and scant of breath
Here Ham- -let take my nap- -kin rub thy brows
The queen carous- -es to thy for- -tune Ham- -let
Good madam!
Gertrude do not drink
I will my lord I pray you par- -don me
I dare not drink yet madam by- -and- -- -by
Come let me wipe thy face
My lord I'll hit him now
I do not think't
Come for the third Laertes you but dal- -ly
I pray you pass with your best vi- -o- -lence
I am afeard you make a wan- -ton of me
Say you so? come on
Noth- -ing nei- -ther way
Have at you now!
Part them they are in- -cen- -s'd
Nay come again!
Look to the queen there ho!
They bleed on both sides. ow is it my lord?
How is't Laertes?
Why as a wood- -cock to my own springe Os- -ric
I am just- -ly kil- -l'd with mine own treach- -ery
How does the Queen?
She swoons to see them bleed
No no! the drink the drink! my dear Ham- -let!
The drink the drink! am poi- -son'd
O vil- -lany! o! let the door be lock- -'d
Treach- -ery! seek it out
It is here Ham- -let Ham- -let thou art slain
No medicine in the world can do thee good
In thee there is not half an hour of life
The treach- -er- -ous in- -stru- -ment is in thy hand
Un- -bat- -ed and en- -ven- -om'd the foul prac- -tice
Hath turn'd it- -self on me lo here I lie
Nev- -er to rise again thy moth- -er's poi- -son'd
I can no more: he king the king's to blame
The point en- -ven- -om'd too!
Then ven- -om to thy work
Os- -ric and Lords
Trea- -son! trea- -son!
O yet de- -fend me friend- -s! I am but hurt
Here thou in- -ces- -tu- -ous mur- -der- -ous damned Dane
Drink off this po- -tion. s thy union here?
Fol- -low my moth- -er
He is just- -ly serv'd
It is a poi- -son tem- -per'd by him- -self
Ex- -change for- -give- -ness with me no- -ble Ham- -let
Mine and my fa- -ther's death come not up- -on thee
Nor thine on me!
Heav- -en make thee free of it! I fol- -low thee
I am dead Ho- -r- -a- -tio. retched queen adieu!
You that look pale and trem- -ble at this chance
That are but mutes or au- -di- -ence to this act
Had I but time, s this fell sergeant death
Is strict in his ar- -rest, I could tell you
But let it be. ora- -tio I am dead
Thou liv'st re- -port me and my cause aright
To the un- -sat- -is- -fied
Nev- -er be- -lieve it
I am more an an- -tique Ro- -man than a Dane
Here's yet some liquor left
As thou'rt a man
Give me the cup let go by heav- -en I'll have't
O good Ho- -r- -a- -tio what a wound- -ed name
Things stand- -ing thus un- -known shall live be- -hind me!
If thou didst ev- -er hold me in thy heart
Ab- -sent thee from fe- -lic- -i- -ty awhile
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my sto- -ry
What war- -like noise is this?
Young Fort- -in- -bras with con- -quest come from Poland
To the am- -bas- -sadors of Eng- -land gives
This war- -like vol- -ley
O I die Ho- -r- -a- -tio
The po- -tent poi- -son quite o'er- -crows my spir- -it
I can- -not live to hear the news from Eng- -land
But I do proph- -esy the elec- -tion lights
On Fort- -in- -bras he has my dy- -ing voice
So tell him with the oc- -cur- -rents more and less
Which have so- -licit- -ed. he rest is si- -lence
Now cracks a no- -ble heart. ood night sweet prince
And flights of an- -gels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hith- -er?
Where is this sight?
What is it you will see?
If aught of woe or won- -der cease your search
This quar- -ry cries on hav- -oc. proud death
What feast is to- -ward in thine eter- -nal cell
That thou so many princes at a shot
So blood- -i- -ly hast struck?
The sight is dis- -mal
And our af- -fairs from Eng- -land come too late
The ears are sense- -less that should give us hear- -ing
To tell him his com- -mand- -ment is ful- -fil- -l'd
That Rosen- -crantz and Guilden- -stern are dead
Where should we have our thanks?
Not from his mouth
Had it the abil- -i- -ty of life to thank you
He nev- -er gave com- -mand- -ment for their death
But since so jump up- -on this bloody ques- -tion
You from the Po- -lack wars and you from Eng- -land
Are here ar- -riv'd give or- -der that these bod- -ies
High on a stage be placed to the view
And let me speak to the yet un- -know- -ing world
How these things came about so shall you hear
Of car- -nal bloody and un- -nat- -u- -ral acts
Of ac- -ci- -den- -tal judg- -ments ca- -su- -al slaugh- -ters
Of deaths put on by cun- -ning and for- -c'd cause
And in this up- -shot pur- -pos- -es mis- -took
Fal- -l'n on the in- -ven- -tors' heads all this can I
Tru- -ly de- -liv- -er
Let us haste to hear it
And call the no- -blest to the au- -di- -ence
For me with sor- -row I em- -brace my for- -tune
I have some rights of mem- -o- -ry in this king- -dom
Which now to claim my van- -tage doth in- -vite me
Of that I shall have al- -so cause to speak
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
But let this same be present- -ly per- -for- -m'd
Even while men's minds are wild lest more mis- -chance
On plots and er- -rors hap- -pen
Let four cap- -tains
Bear Ham- -let like a sol- -dier to the stage
For he was like- -ly had he been put on
To have prov'd most roy- -al- -ly and for his pas- -sage
The sol- -dier- -s' mu- -sic and the rites of war
Speak loud- -ly for him
Take up the bod- -ies. uch a sight as this
Be- -comes the field but here shows much amiss
Go bid the sol- -diers shoot
